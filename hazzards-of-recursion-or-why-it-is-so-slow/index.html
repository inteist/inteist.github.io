  <!-- <hr> -->
  <p>I think that I will be not the only one and definitely not the first one to  claim that recursion is a an educational milestone in Computer Science  disciplines. When it comes to understanding recursion, that's one of the "truth  moments" in your Computer Science career. If you don't feel comfortable with  recursion and don't understand it - you should probably leave the field. Some  people claim the same about pointers, but well, even when I find it to be true,  nowadays pointer arithmetic plays much less significant role then before, when  computer had several hundreds of kilobytes of memory and being able to do  pointer arithmetic was considered  a "must master" for any  programmer. I guess at a time there was really no other choice at  all.</p>

<p>This leads to much more interesting and broader subjects. I remember those  times when we were talking of buying 512MB of RAM, creating a RAM-drive and  loading there Windows98, so it will run smoother. Well, we were just kids at a  time. Nevertheless what I wanted to say was about recursion.</p>

<p>Every CS student has heard at least once during his career "Recursion is cool,  however - DON'T use it!". Some might wonder well, why is it so? Well - in fact  the recursion is cool indeed, BUT is slow as hell! I have compared just for fun  some code that was using a recursion versus non recursive code, and it appeared  that non recursive code was about 10 times (!!!!) faster for significant amount  of computation. And when I say significant, I mean several hours of  runtime.</p>

<p>One must ask - but why? And the answer would be - this is due to stack frames  allocations of course. It turns out that it is quite costly to open a new stack  frame. I believe there are other reasons as well, which maybe depend on the  programming language, but this would be the most obvious one. So kids, don't say  I didn't warn you - don't try this at home!</p>
