    <p>If you are using Chrome and Firefox and well pretty much any other popular browser, you are used to switching tabs with CMD+number which switches to the desired tab e.g. CMD+1 will switch to the first tab (including the pinned ones for Chrome). This however does not work for Safari.</p>

<p>For safari to cycle between tabs use <strong>CMD+SHIFT+Left/Right</strong></p>

    <p>If you were playing with the "Live Tiles" from the latest (at the moment) OS update to the Windows Phone code named "Mango", you might have been wondering what makes Live tiles unique and how many live tiles can be placed on the home screen of the user. Accidentally I found out that what makes the live tile unique is the tile reference or the tile URI</p>

<p>a usual way to create a tile would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="n">ShellTile</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Uri</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/GotoPage.xaml?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2, UriKind.Relative), tileData);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>so whenever you change the value1 and value 2, a new live tile can be created.</p>

<p>Happy coding and have fun with the live tiles!</p>

    <p>If you are getting the:</p>

<p><strong>"failed to connect to device as it is pin locked"</strong></p>

<p>when trying to deploy your app to a windows phone 7 device no worries. Just make sure to disable the "screen lock" or "screensaver" whatever it is called. That's what it is all about!</p>

<p>I was lucky to figure this one immediately but if you got here means you got stuck with it and had to look it up. Hopefully this will help you with that problem.</p>

    <p>If you are getting an error similar to the error below while trying to install and/or update BlackBerry SDK as a plugin for Eclipse</p>

<p><code><br />
An error occurred while collecting items to be installed session context was:<br />

...<br />
</code></p>

<p>You are in luck!</p>

<p>Your problems are over as you found the solution. All you need to do is to clear the "Secure Storage" contents. To do that go to</p>

<p><strong>Windows -> Preferences</strong></p>

<p>Type <em>secure</em>, drill down to find the <em>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.repository</em>, expand this, and you will see the <em>swdownloads.blackberry.com</em>. Select this entry and delete it. This should resolve the issue next time you try to update/install the plugin you should be asked again for your credentials to the BlackBerry developer portal and once you put them in the installation should proceed normally.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here's how it looks in Eclipse:<br />

    <p>Eclipse is a great tool that I have been using for mmm... wow (!!!) probably about 7 years now and the most amazing thing about it is of course all the plugins that can really extend the functionality of the basic editor and make it highly personalized. This is great, but some things should just be in a good IDE. Like built in SVN integration. Seriously, why do I need to install a plugin for something so basic? Netbeans is another great IDE, but I use it less as most my development environments come from dedicated Eclipse plugins and while it is possible to do the development in Netbeans it is not as convenient and straightforward and this is what we the pragmatic programmers usually prefer.</p>

<p>So one nice thing I got used to in Netbeans is how it colors the changes that I made in the editor if the file is under version control (e.g. SVN). After I used Netbeans for a while and got to like this feature, when I got back to Eclipse I kinda missed it. It's nice and convenient. Quite non obtrusive i.e. it doesn't get in your way - you may not even be noticing this if you don't know about it.</p>

<p>Anyways, turns out that it is quite easy to enable similar functionality for Eclipse, alas you have to have SVN plugin I suppose for the "diff" to work. Just follow the screenshot if you want to enable coloring of SVN changes in Eclipse similar to Netbeans.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here's how it will look (you can change colors if you want)</p>

    <p>Very energizing and inspiring video about Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor with the Adreno GPU. Wide deployment of the SnapDragon processors (<strong>including in the new iPhone 4S</strong>) makes it so more attractive to develop for.</p>

    <p>Today I noticed that users of the Android app started experiencing problem with posting to Facebook, getting the following error:</p>

<p><center><strong>There was a problem generating the Feed story from the provided data</strong></center></p>

<p>There have already been a few threads on StackOverflow like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7581188/feed-dialog-generating-errors-with-ios-sdk">this one for iOS</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7581056/facebook-android-sdk-there-was-a-problem-generating-the-feed-story-from-the-pro">this one for Android</a>.</p>

<p>It definitely like a problem Facebook created (once again – sigh)... I will try to update this entry with a resolution once there is one. Hopefully though Facebook developers will just fix this bug on their end as there are a lot of developers (including myself) who had their code working for months with no problems until today.</p>

<p>You can see the status of the bug and add yourself to the list <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/295765603772094">here</a>. Although the bug is open just for iOS, once fixed for iOS, it should be also fixed for Android.</p>

<p>If you happen to know how to fix this, please leave your response in the comments and I will update this entry so that others can fix this problem for their users in the meantime.</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong> 6:45 EST - it seems that the problem has been resolved! Yey! Hopefully some users will realize that we (the developers) are not the ones to blame (most of the time) that Facebook integration suddenly stopped working. Hopefully the ones that realize this will stop giving bad ratings on App Store and Android Market because of that.</p>

    <p>So I just heard about the upcoming "contracts" concept for future versions of Microsoft products (the contracts will probably get propagated at least partially into virtually all Microsoft products like Windows Phone, XBox, Tablet OS versions etc). The general idea seems to be that various applications will be able to share data and communicate otherwise not really disclosing too much about their functionality.</p>

<p>It is exciting news yeah, but why does it so painfully reminds me of Android "intents" system? To me it is exactly the same. Although some sources say it has some ideas similar to what former Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie’s proposed as the “universal clipboard” concept — dating back to 2006. I still find it hard to see how this is different from Android's intents system. It would be interesting to watch who sues who over that if at all. The huge piles of patents Google and Microsoft have do not make much sense to go to war over this.</p>

<p>It is interesting though to see how one of the most important features/ideas of Android OS gets propagated into other operating systems.</p>

    <p>I am one of the lucky people who managed to snatch a ticket to Google I/O this year. The event was sold in a record time - 58 minutes. The servers crashed instantly during the registration process and it was quite nerv wrecking. In fact I could only register after 2 hours the registration started when the servers have finally came up using a link from the cache of my browser which included session ID, where my ticket was already saved for me just before the servers crashed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to put the Google I/O live badge so here it is:</p>

    <p>I have recently started using TextMate. It's been some time I wanted to give it a try and understand why so many people rave about it but every time I needed to use it, I usually wanted to do something very simple and sometimes I just got overwhelmed by all the options and sometimes I just didn't want to invest а lot of time into figuring out how to "use" TextMate beyond the most basic stuff.</p>

<p>One of the options I missed and couldn't find an easy way to do was to go to the last edit. After some searching however I did find a plugin that does that. You can <a href="http://email.eva.mpg.de/~bibiko/downloads/textmate/TMGoToLastEdit.tmplugin.zip">download the go to last edit plugin for TextMate</a> plugin and once you install it, you will have the "go to last edit" awesomeness in your TextMate. Use the<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;"><strong>⌥⌘J</strong><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;"> combination to activate the plugin. It uses the "undo/redo" mechanism but this particular plugin solves some problems that some other apple scripts or other solutions that use undo/redo technique had.</span></span></p>

<p>Enjoy this plugin and enjoy TextMate, although I actually like my MacVim better for most of the stuff I wanted to use TextMate for :). And actually I find Netbeans to be very good for JS, I started using TextMate for JS, but now I almost exclusively use Netbeans. Share your thoughts, opinions and experience  with TextMate plugins and with Mac editors in general in the comments.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Just got an email from RIM with news and such and noticed the link to the OS center they run on their website to help developers choose which BB OS to target. After looking at the stats, I decided to make a comparison and see how the official stats from RIM differ from what I see within my applications.</p>

<p>Here's the distribution published by RIM (dated March 3-d) I am not sure what they compiled into the March 3-d, i.e. what the timestamp of March 3-d actually means. Was it based on OS tracked for March 3-d, was it for last month, week or such. I couldn't find that information.</p>

<p><a src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2011-04-28-at-12.12.36-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-541" title="BlackBerry OS distribution March 3d 2011" src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2011-04-28-at-12.12.36-AM-300x196.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a>And below is the distribution I have compiled from the data for the month of April 2011 (a month worth of data)</p>

<p><a src="http://inteist.com/media/BlackBerry-OS-distribution-April-2011.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542" title="BlackBerry OS distribution April 2011" src="http://inteist.com/media/BlackBerry-OS-distribution-April-2011-300x286.png" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></a>The breakdown by OS version is not identical but the picture is pretty much similar, except that <del>my chart is much nicer</del> I've got 6.1 devices (hmmm!) and the 5.0 OS section is a bit larger for my statistics than it is for the official statistics. But again, the official statistics are pretty much 2 month old now and actually since the rest of the sections pretty much coincide with the official statistics, I would assume that the number of OS 5.0 just got larger in these 2 month; which by itself is great news for BB developers. Hooray to that and I will try to keep up with statistics to see how the distribution shifts, maybe another post in couple month or when something interesting happens. Let me know in the comments if you'd like to see something like that in the future and whether it was useful for you.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2011</span>
    <hr>

    <p>I do an OTA (over the air) distribution for BlackBerry. Some time ago, I wrote here how to [link id='206' text='setup the mime types for the OTA distribution on Amazon S3']. Luckily now, S3 has got a new and very useful web interface, as well as improved mime type detection. They still get the file types not exactly right, but close enough so that the OTA installation for BlackBerry works on "autodetect" settings just fine.</p>

<p>This is however not about S3, this is about detecting the proper OS version of the BlackBerry OS from the user agent of the browser using a few very simple regular expressions.  The code is tailored to PHP, but you can easily adapt it to any language that supports Perl style regular expressions, or you can adapt the reg. expressions as well based on this simple idea:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">       $agent = //get user agent raw string</span>

<span class="x">        if (preg_match(&quot;/BlackBerry/i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>

<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/6\.0\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;6.0&quot;;                </span>
<span class="x">            }            </span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/5\.0\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;5.0&quot;;                </span>
<span class="x">            }</span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/4\.7\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;4.7&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">            }</span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/4\.6\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;4.6&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">            }</span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/4\.5\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;4.5&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">            }</span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/4\.3\../i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;4.3&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">            }</span>
<span class="x">            if (preg_match(&quot;/4\.2\.1/i&quot;, $agent)) {</span>
<span class="x">                $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] = &quot;4.2.1&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">            }</span>

<span class="x">            //Form your download URL here</span>

<span class="x">        } else {</span>
<span class="x">            //This is not BlackBerry user agent</span>
<span class="x">        }</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing complicated, but this should give a start point to any one tying to serve appropriate bundle via OTA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you were to use S3, then it would basically be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">// The main link to S3</span>
<span class="x">$downloadURL = &quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_BUCKET/releases/&quot; . $newRelease[&#39;version_folder&#39;] . &quot;/&quot; . $newRelease[&#39;os_folder&#39;] . &quot;/YourAppName.jad&quot;;</span>

    <p>Great collection of design rules by Eric S. Raymond<br />
<a title="Eric S. Raymond" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</li>
<li>Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.</li>
<li>Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.</li>
<li>Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.</li>
<li>Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.</li>
<li>Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</li>
<li>Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.</li>
<li>Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.</li>
<li>Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.</li>
<li>Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.</li>
<li>Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.</li>
<li>Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.</li>
<li>Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.</li>
<li>Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.</li>
<li>Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for "one true way".</li>
<li>Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have created the very simple [link id='124' text='text formatter plugin for DokuWiki'] mainly to solve the problem of pasting some text with line breaks. DokuWiki by default ignores these line breaks and this was a problem for me. Without knowing any better I quickly put together the [link id='124' text='wpre plugin'] which simply wraps whatever you want with &lt;pre&gt; tag. I later learned that there is a better plugin for this. It's called <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:linebreak" target="_blank">linebreak</a>. It works fine for me, even with the latest DokuWiki release, but it seems that the author suggest to use <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:xbr" target="_blank">xbr</a> plugin instead.</p>

    <p>I wrote yesterday about [link id='434' text="my (mostly) negative experience working with these companies"], but some of you might give it a try and maybe your results will be much better or maybe things have actually improved lately. In any case, the code here should get you up to speed covering most of the dirty work of working with these companies' APIs.</p>

<p>I will post 4 classes here:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AdGrabber </strong>-  main abstract class to give all other specific grabbers structure and save some repeating code</li>
<li><strong>MillenialAdGrabber </strong>- MillennialMedia specific grabber</li>
<li><strong>NexAgeAdGrabber </strong>- right, NexAge specific grabber</li>
<li><strong>SomaAdGrabber </strong>- the SMAATO ad grabber. Their ad platform is dubbed SOMA, hence the name</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

<p>At some point in the past I was trying to monetize free application on BlackBerry and since most of the advertising networks that actually work with BlackBerry don't have an SDK, I had to work with their WEB APIs directly.</p>

<p>This did not work for me at all (with minor exception for Quattro Wireless). Maybe this was personal to me, I don't know, probably not. The monetization through advertising on BlackBerry is unfortunately does not work. I am talking from a lot of experience supporting free applications with ads on Android and iOS.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time looking for advertising agencies working with BlackBerry and then signing up and then getting the necessary information from them and then working through their documentation to implement a custom web client to pull the info from their web APIs - all this to learn once again that<strong> the revenue I could get is a </strong><strong>joke</strong>.</p>

<h2>Quattro Wireless</h2>

<p>Advertising with Quattro Wireless actually turned out to be the best BlackBerry advertising experience I had so far... As long as it lasted (not very long unfortunately).</p>

<p>Starting Sept. 30 1020 Quattro is iAd exclusive and stopped serving any ads to BlackBerry. Since I do not ever trust what I can get from advertising service, when the service stopped, the application was not impacted but other developers that were less careful (something you should not ever do though) might have had some problems.</p>

<h2>NexAge</h2>

<p>NexAge left me with<strong> the</strong> <strong>worst</strong> <strong>impression </strong>of all. First these guys at NexAge took a hell lot of my time with manual sign up and many  many phone calls I had to have with them to get anywhere. It looked very suspicious to me that they can't implement an automatic sign up and to actually sign up for the service you had to talk to them over the phone. I should have known better at this point. Coupled with their awfully looking website, this fact should have stopped me from moving forward with them and saving a lot of my time and frustration. But since there were not many options at a time, I decided to try them out. The interesting part is that when I voiced my concerns about the manual sign-up to some higher up developer relations manager, he told me "We are the BMW of advertising, we give you a personalized and best service out there"... yeah... right...  After signing up with them and integrating their code (there were a few hiccups on the way but nothing deal breaking) I started to serve their advertisements and the results were - well... simply put horrible. When I talked to them they were not really helpful and they kept saying "we will investigate and will try to optimize". I wonder if they are optimizing the ads manually as the sign-up. After couple weeks of my pilot with them, during which I wrote them and called them to complain about the ridiculousness of the revenue with not much results (they mostly simply ignored me) I shut them down and decided to forget about them and about the partial revenue I have generated in these couple weeks for the sake of my own mental health. I have to point out that they did have an SDK - a ridiculously large SDK, so I decided that I can not add an SDK which is almost as much as half of my whole application size, especially while I can implement the same thing with couple classes.</p>

<h2>SMAATO</h2>

<p>With <strong>SMAATO</strong> everything was much simpler, but the revenue was as bad if not worse as with NexAge. After trying them for some time and not seeing any improvement, I gave up on them.</p>

<h2>MillennialMedia</h2>

<p>With Millenial, it was more complicated. At some point I was simply furious with them and if there were any other options to advertise on BlackBerry, I would definitely avoid them, but since there aren't I still work with them in a very limited capacity. I was so so sorry to learn that they are going to handle the technology side of RIM's advertising service. The reason is simple - they are SUPER unorganized. And coupled with RIM, they just doubled the amount of mess. For example, they say you are ready to serve ads and you are fully operational and you publish your app and then you see some super weird stats and you ask them and they tell you some BS and then you wait a little more and then you ask again and then a few weeks later they say - "Ohh the ads you were serving are test ads". To make things even worse - this happened to me more than once.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, unfortunately, if you want to monetize your free application on BlackBerry - you better prepare yourself for the worst. I was hoping the official RIM advertising service will solve this problem, but unfortunately it didn't. It's a complete mess, as I mentioned and I don't think they are going to sort this out any time soon. If you are a developer that knows of a better service - please let me know, I would appreciate it. Hopefully my experience also helps you to save some of your time. If you are eager to try anyway, I plan to post the custom integration code that I wrote here so that you (again) can save some time reusing this code.</p>

<p>I have been to a presentation by Harry Heyman - the first non founder employee of Foursquare. He presented on the Foursquare's usage of <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, a rapidly gaining popularity NoSQL database. Quickly - the idea behind NoSQL database that it is not based on a relational model as most traditional databases but rather on a document model.</p>

<p>Harry had many interesting things but the one thing that was especially interesting to me was that they <strong>basically run all the DB operations of FourSquare in RAM! </strong>Yes that's right. They employ the extra large memory instances on EC2, running with 64GB or RAM and they shard whenever they start approaching certain limits of RAM.</p>

<p>The outages they had in early October were because they hit the memory limit and the databases started to page in and out the data from the hard drives to the memory and back and this quickly brought them down.</p>

<p>He mentioned that this is however not Mongo's fault and this would have happened with any database they would have used. Which is interesting by itself because it means that the way the application is engineered - the requirements is that all the data that they operate has to be in RAM for the application to be fast enough. I bet there is a lot of smart engineers working at Foursquare and there has to be a good reason for that and in fact Harry mentioned that they basically have to have almost all the checkins available in memory due to the nature of the queries they have to perform on the data.  He also mentioned that when (this seemed more of a "when" rather than "if") they move to dedicated servers with solid state drives, they should not have that limit anymore because then the hard drives (SSDs) in that case will be fast enough.</p>

<p>For me all this was very surprising and I am still a little puzzled about it and wonder whether there is/was no way of engineering the application so that they don't have to keep pretty much all their data (about 5 million users and 160 million checkins at the moment), all in RAM.</p>

    <p>Just installed the new Android SDK - 2.3 and wondering where's "ADB"? Don't worry it's there.</p>

<p>In there recent release of the Android 2.3 codenamed "Gingerbread" the SDK's directory was a little restructured. In particular the ADB (Android debug bridge) the tool that is used to communicate with the Android emulator instances and connected device has been moved. Previously you could find it in the</p>

<blockquote><p>path_to_your_Android_SDK_installation<strong>/tools</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>folder.</p>

<p>But since the Android 2.3 (or API 9) the /<strong>tools</strong> folder was renamed to /<strong>platform-tools </strong>folder, so if you are wondering why suddenly your <em>&gt;adb </em>command does not work - this is the reason and updating the PATH should fix it.</p>

    <h3><strong>Problem:</strong></h3>

<p>You are getting the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>android Error generating final archive: Debug certificate expired on ...</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>One day when you opened your Eclipse with Android tool chain installed, suddenly you see this error, which may seem weird because you know that Eclipse uses just some random certificate for debugging and so why is it expired and what to do.</p>

<h3><strong>The Solution: </strong></h3>

<p><strong></strong>Simply delete the keystore file which is located in</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>%USERHOME%/.android/debug.keystore</strong> (on Windows)</p></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>~/.android/debug.keystore </strong>(on Linux and OS X)</p></blockquote>

<p>Restart your eclipse and you are all set.</p>

<h3><strong>Why this happens</strong>:</h3>

<p>The reason to this is that the debug certificate is set to expire every year or 365 days.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to be bothered by this again in a year, you can use the <strong>keytool</strong> executable from the Android tool chain to generate a certificate with a longer expiration period.</p>

    <p>In the following video, the web experience on the BlackBerry Playbook is compared to the web experience on the iPad. It is clearly shown (the video is made by RIM) that PlayBook significantly outperforms the iPad. While these tests are definitely subjective since they are performed by RIM, so they could choose website favorable to the PlayBook and otherwise objectively-subjectively give the PlayBook some edge, the interesting thing to note is that the PlayBook uses the open source WebKit browser initially developed by Apple. It is a very interesting camparo nevertheless.</p>

<p>Would be very interesting to see the Samsung Galaxy Tab running Android participate in this comparison, especially since it has the same 7" form factor as the PlayBook and it has Flash enabled of course.</p>

<p>Enjoy the video and let me know what you think!</p>

    <p>After recent upgrade to my DokuWiki installation (I jumped from <strong>Mulled Wine </strong>straight to the latest release - <strong>Anteater</strong>)</p>

<p>I was getting this weird error:</p>

<blockquote><p>call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]: First argument is expected to be a valid callback, 'Doku_Renderer_metadata::section_edit' was given</p></blockquote>

<p>the solution was to disable all the plugins and re-enable them again. Not sure why it worked, but it worked and the error is gone now! So if you experience the same error - try this. If it doesn't help, another good idea could be gradually re-enable plugins and see which one is the offender. Good Luck!</p>

    <p>This is a great comics I came across, very  concise and true!</p>

<p>I especially liked the dinosaur. BlackBerry are dinosaur outdated both in the features and especially from the development perspective. I covered this before in my [intlink id="75" type="post"]Android vs. BlackBerry development post[/intlink].</p>

    <p>Today, at the annual PDC10 conference, Microsoft is showing love for its developers and promoting its coming Windows Phone 7 by giving all the attendees a free Windows Phone 7. This follows in the steps of similar giveaways by Google at Google/IO 2009 and Goole/IO 2010, Motorola and Adobe giveaway at Adobe Max 2010. With many companies following Google's example, Google so far is by far the leading company on these giveaways.</p>

<p>Microsoft is expected to spend more than 400 millions on the promotion of its Windows Phone 7 . Here's hoping that registered and published developers will get a free phone or at least discounted phones since as of now, it is quite hard to get your hands on a a phone and this is obviously crucial to testing the apps in real live scenarios, on real hardware.</p>

    <p>I needed recently to basically remove my app installation from the Windows Phone 7 emulator. I could not find how you can remove the app from the emulator, but I found a way to reset and force the Windows Phone 7 emulator to cold boot.</p>

<p>You can clear the windows phone emulator state, by deleting the saved state file in:</p>

<blockquote><p>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\XDE\*.dess</p></blockquote>

<p>You can just hit the windows key on your keyboard and paste this "%ProgramData%\Microsoft\XDE\" and you will be taken to the right location.</p>

<p>Delete the *.dess files. This will force the emulator to reset and run the cold boot sequence.</p>

<p>Too bad, it's not possible to do simulator reset right from the development tools. Here's hoping that Windows Phone Tools development team will improve that situation in the future releases.</p>

<p>Please share your thought in comments.</p>

<p>So, as you probably already know, the coming BlackBerry table will be powered by the QNX pronounced almost like Unix - "ku-nee-ks". So what is QNX?</p>
<div></div>
<p>Below are some notes from the session delivered for developers right after the tablet was introduced during the keynote speech at the DevCon2010.</p>
<div>QNX - is a highly distributed, self healing POSIX compliant, real time operating system.</div>
<div></div>
<p>Real time here basically means preemptive partitioning, which in turn means patented scheduling mechanism for dynamic resource allocation. Here we are talking about CPU as the main resource.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Self Healing - since the system is based on POSIX - message passing, only the core kernel (0.1 million lines of code in total, compared to 70+ million lines in Windows and 9+ million lines in Linux kernels) and the process manager are at the core, all the other processes, can be hot restarted. The key issue here to take home is that QNX is highly modular system unlike the much more monolithic Windows and Linux systems. The monolithic kernel only consists of the microkernel and the process manager - a small partition of all OS code which can be highly optimized and is easier to monitor for bugs. All the rest of the OS systems are "hot pluggable" modules which run in their own processes and can be restarted without taking down the whole system. This is the main point of QNX being highly resilient system and the term used by Dan Dodge the co-founder and the CEO of QNX systems - self healing.</p>
<div></div>
<p>QNX will support Adobe mobile Air and Flash for start and is fully capable of running the Java JVM which should enable the table to run any Java applications written with native BlackBerry SDK for OS 6.0 (and probably anything above level 6.0 SDK). There is also an option of a native C/C++ development for QNX. Momentics - the native developer environment - an Eclipse plugin. QNX is apparently company #3 to join the Eclipse project early on - at the Eclipse 1.0 stage and the main contributor to the C/C++ CDT project. The Momentics environment has a rich set of tooling for coding, debugging and profiling the natively written applications for the QNX.</p>

    <p>In a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>, Google announced that it is significantly expanding payment support both for developers and the users.</p>

<p>Developers in 29 countries will be able to sell their apps and users from 32 countries will be able to buy paid apps. The most recently added countries in which the Android users will be able to buy apps are: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Addition to support of paid application distribution is expanded to the developers in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Android is closing the paid application gap with the iPhone quite fast, while BlackBerry still lags behind.</p>

    <div id="_mcePaste">From the few sessions it was clear that RIM as a whole is still not getting it - the consumer market for smart phones has long surpassed the enterprise market. They are still trying to cater to weird enterprise scenarios and impress developers with these capabilities. RIM has to wake up and realize that the number of developers caring about enterprise features declines exponentially.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Same as with the networking which is a pure hell because there are at least 7 different ways to establish a network connection, they are trying to cater to different scenarios and have all these different ways of doing pretty much the same thing in 5 ways. Seriously - <strong>WHY??? </strong>Just give us <strong>one </strong>but <strong>RELIABLE</strong> way of doing something. Don't you get it that we - the developers don't want to implement something in more than one way and then debug it forever or yet, to have to implement something in 3 ways because you are not sure (and don't really have a good way of telling) which way will work for every specific user. You have to start repeating this every day as your daily mantra - the simpler it is, the less it breaks. This is a universal engineering fact. Would you please already get this? When you do it will make the life of developers so much easier.</div>
