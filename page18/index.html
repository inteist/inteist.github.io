It is clearly shown (the video is made by RIM) that PlayBook significantly outperforms the iPad. While these tests are definitely subjective since they are performed by RIM, so they could choose website favorable to the PlayBook and otherwise objectively-subjectively give the PlayBook some edge, the interesting thing to note is that the PlayBook uses the open source WebKit browser initially developed by Apple. It is a very interesting camparo nevertheless.</p> <p>Would be very interesting to see the Samsung Galaxy Tab running Android participate in this comparison, especially since it has the same 7" form factor as the PlayBook and it has Flash enabled of course.</p> <p>Enjoy the video and let me know what you think!</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blackberry PlayBook vs. Apple iPad comparison:</strong><br /> <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="390" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/s72rGDUn2uo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/s72rGDUn2uo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object></p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/dokuwiki-upgrade-error/"> DokuWiki Upgrade Error </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>After recent upgrade to my DokuWiki installation (I jumped from <strong>Mulled Wine </strong>straight to the latest release - <strong>Anteater</strong>)</p> <p>I was getting this weird error:</p> <blockquote><p>call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]: First argument is expected to be a valid callback, 'Doku_Renderer_metadata::section_edit' was given</p></blockquote> <p>the solution was to disable all the plugins and re-enable them again.

With many companies following Google's example, Google so far is by far the leading company on these giveaways.</p> <p>Microsoft is expected to spend more than 400 millions on the promotion of its Windows Phone 7 . Here's hoping that registered and published developers will get a free phone or at least discounted phones since as of now, it is quite hard to get your hands on a a phone and this is obviously crucial to testing the apps in real live scenarios, on real hardware.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/windows-phone-7-how-reset-clean-emulator/"> Windows Phone 7 – How to Reset Emulator </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>I needed recently to basically remove my app installation from the Windows Phone 7 emulator.

This will force the emulator to reset and run the cold boot sequence.</p> <p>Too bad, it's not possible to do simulator reset right from the development tools.

So what is QNX?</p> <div></div> <p>Below are some notes from the session delivered for developers right after the tablet was introduced during the keynote speech at the DevCon2010.</p> <div>QNX - is a highly distributed, self healing POSIX compliant, real time operating system.</div> <div></div> <p>Real time here basically means preemptive partitioning, which in turn means patented scheduling mechanism for dynamic resource allocation. Here we are talking about CPU as the main resource.</p> <div></div> <p>Self Healing - since the system is based on POSIX - message passing, only the core kernel (0.1 million lines of code in total, compared to 70+ million lines in Windows and 9+ million lines in Linux kernels) and the process manager are at the core, all the other processes, can be hot restarted. The key issue here to take home is that QNX is highly modular system unlike the much more monolithic Windows and Linux systems. The monolithic kernel only consists of the microkernel and the process manager - a small partition of all OS code which can be highly optimized and is easier to monitor for bugs. All the rest of the OS systems are "hot pluggable" modules which run in their own processes and can be restarted without taking down the whole system. This is the main point of QNX being highly resilient system and the term used by Dan Dodge the co-founder and the CEO of QNX systems - self healing.</p> <div></div> <p>QNX will support Adobe mobile Air and Flash for start and is fully capable of running the Java JVM which should enable the table to run any Java applications written with native BlackBerry SDK for OS 6.0 (and probably anything above level 6.0 SDK). There is also an option of a native C/C++ development for QNX. Momentics - the native developer environment - an Eclipse plugin. QNX is apparently company #3 to join the Eclipse project early on - at the Eclipse 1.0 stage and the main contributor to the C/C++ CDT project. The Momentics environment has a rich set of tooling for coding, debugging and profiling the natively written applications for the QNX.</p> <p>If you are interested in the latest updates, you should head to the following resources:</p> <div> <ul> <li>The official <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/tablet.jsp" target="_blank">blackberry resource for the developers interested in tablet OS</a></li> <li>The official <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flash/blackberrytabos/" target="_blank">Adobe resource for the developers interested in BlackBerry tablet OS</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div> <ul></ul> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/android-expands-support-for-paid-application-to-more-countries-and-developers/"> Android Expands Support for Paid Application to More Countries and Developers </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>In a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>, Google announced that it is significantly expanding payment support both for developers and the users.</p> <p>Developers in 29 countries will be able to sell their apps and users from 32 countries will be able to buy paid apps.

They are still trying to cater to weird enterprise scenarios and impress developers with these capabilities. RIM has to wake up and realize that the number of developers caring about enterprise features declines exponentially.</div> <div></div> <div>Same as with the networking which is a pure hell because there are at least 7 different ways to establish a network connection, they are trying to cater to different scenarios and have all these different ways of doing pretty much the same thing in 5 ways. Seriously - <strong>WHY??? </strong>Just give us <strong>one </strong>but <strong>RELIABLE</strong> way of doing something. Don't you get it that we - the developers don't want to implement something in more than one way and then debug it forever or yet, to have to implement something in 3 ways because you are not sure (and don't really have a good way of telling) which way will work for every specific user. You have to start repeating this every day as your daily mantra - the simpler it is, the less it breaks. This is a universal engineering fact. Would you please already get this? When you do it will make the life of developers so much easier.</div> <div></div> <div></div> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/blackberry-developer-conference-2010-is-tomorrow/"> BlackBerry Developer Conference 2010 Is Tomorrow </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>BlackBerry Developer conference is starting tomorrow. I have arrived to San Francisco at noon today and just had a relaxing day browsing the sity, visiting the beautiful Chinatown and the Coit Tower from where you can see pretty much the whole city. It's my second time in San Francisco, first time being here about 1.5 years ago for the Google I/O 2009 (so sorry had to miss it this year...). San Francisco is an interesting city and I like it, but it is a little dirty for my snobby Bostonian taste.</p> <p>Anyhow, this is not about the city. BBDevCon 2010 is tomorrow and I am expecting it to be a turnkey for me, it was a long time of [intlink id="75" type="post"]love and hate relation[/intlink] between me and BlackBerry. The platform is not evolving (yeah yeah, BB OS 6 - whatever... this is so 3 years ago) and in the super fast paced space as mobile, standing still is actually equals to moving back as everyone is innovating with the speed of light.</p> <p>I will be looking for cues as to whether RIM will be able to at least [intlink id="285" type="post"]maintain its current user base[/intlink] and improve his ways in treating smaller indie developers.</p> <p>There have been rummors about BB Tablet - BlackPad, to be announced during the BB DevCon 2010. I am personally very skeptical about it, but we will see. Also - it is almost clear to everyone that RIM will announce it's advertising API availability to the public - not great news though. They have the worst performing advertising so far, and this is one of the major points for me personally, if there is no promising (I am not even wishing for bright) future on the horizon, BlackBerry will be the last platform to receive any attention on my list.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/facebook-is-down-funny-tweets-collection/"> Facebook Is Down - Funny Tweets Collection </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p style="text-align: left;">Apparently today Facebook was down for 2 hours and for some even more...
