    <h4>Problem</h4>

<p>The redirect was not working. It was forcing a file download but was not redirecting the page. Turns out Jekyll does not correctly parse the case where the <strong>redirect_from</strong> </p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>You need to add a trailing slat to the <code>redirect_from:URL</code> i.e. <code>redirect_from: /old_slug/</code> not
<code>redirect_from: /old_slug</code>. Note the trailing slash. This is how it is supposed to be done.</p>

    <p>I had a weird Java error appear after updating to <a href="http://fabric.io">Fabric</a>. It turned out the problem was - I forgot to remove the <code>crashlytics.jar</code> from the libs folder and there were still a few libraries there and the whole folder was getting compiled so when Fabric got added through <code>aarr</code> file, I ended up with 2 copies of the library, which created the problem.</p>

<p>The initialization for <a href="http://fabric.io">Fabric</a> is a little different now too.</p>

<p>It even had the bot functionality back then and many more features which were apparently waaay ahead of its time. It took 5 years and a company that only does that (that would be Slack) to get everyone who&#39;s anyone to drink their cool aid. </p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 May 2014</span>
    <hr>

    <p>Android has often more than one way of doing something but it is not because of a poor design, rather because of the many possibilities that are available to Android developer and it is important to understand the nuances between various options to achieve something and choose the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Let's look at services:</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">IntentService vs. Service</h3>

<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>

<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>The <em>Service</em> can be used in tasks with no UI, but shouldn't be too long. If you need to perform long tasks, you must use threads within Service.</li>
<li>The <em>IntentService</em> can be used in long tasks usually with no communication to Main Thread. If communication is required, can use Main Thread handler or broadcast intents. Another case of use is when callbacks are needed (Intent triggered tasks).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to trigger?</strong></p>

<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>The <em>Service</em> is triggered calling to method onStartService().</li>
<li>The <em>IntentService</em> is triggered using an Intent, it spawns a new worker thread and the method onHandleIntent() is called on this thread.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Triggered From</strong></p>

<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>The <em>Service</em> may be triggered from any thread.</li>
<li>The <em>IntentService</em> must be triggered from Main Thread.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Runs On</strong></p>

<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>The <em>Service</em> runs in background but it runs on the Main Thread of the application.</li>
<li>The <em>IntentService</em> runs on a separate worker thread.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations / Drawbacks</strong></p>

<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>The <em>Service</em> may block the Main Thread of the application.</li>
<li>The <em>IntentService</em> cannot run tasks in parallel. Hence all the consecutive intents will go into the message queue for the worker thread and will execute sequentially.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Frustrated with flaky settings on Mavericks for energy savings? Puts your stuff to sleep when you don't want to and doesn't put it to sleep when you do? </p>

<pre>pmset</pre>

<p> comes to the rescue</p>

<p>I used the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo pmset displaysleep <span class="m">10</span> sleep 0
</code></pre></div>
<p>since I want my displays to go to sleep after 10 minutes and the computer never go to sleep.</p>

<p>To specify behavior for when on battery power use the
<pre>-b</pre>
<p> switch e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo pmset -b displaysleep <span class="m">5</span> sleep 15
</code></pre></div>
<p>to put your display to sleep after 5 minutes of idling and your computer after 15 minutes of idling.</p>

    <p>Evernote seems to be great tool for note taking and keeping pretty much everything you want organized. I used to use a <a href="http://dokuwiki.com">wiki</a> but recently I decided to give Evernote a second or third or fourth try. I am not sure what the number here is but this is the first time it actually clicked with me and I think I am actually going to use it instead of my wiki and switch to it completely. They just didn't have the the ecosystem in place when I tried it the first X times. Now they cover almost every platform and the support on the desktop is just great!</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There are some limitations for every account be it a free account or premium or even business account. When I first thought about the limitations I thought - that sucks... But then I thought - hey, let's put this in perspective and see how "real" these limitations are.</span></p>

<p>So the limits are:</p>

<table style="border: 1px solid #8a888b; width: 80%;" border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Number of notes</td>
<td> 100,000</td>

    <p>A recently popular new startup that is making waves, namely <a href="http://secret.ly">Secret.ly</a> was quite soon hacked after it was first released, giving the attacker access to the identity of the poster, effectively defeating the purpose of the secrecy. So they said "We take security seriously" and <a href="https://hackerone.com/secret">threw a public challenge</a> to the hackers around the world... Or so it seems becase there are no real incentives besides curiosity and pride and maybe some swag from secretly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the not so known messaging app created by the brothers Nikolay and Pavel Durov. While the latter is well known being the founder of the most popular russian social networking site VK.com, his brother Nikolay is less know and he was the one to device the new communication and <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">open source protocol MTProto</a> for the Telegram. Telegram is non profit, partially open source (the Protocol and API code is open so every one who is skeptical can make sure that it is truly secure) and is absolutely free. It is available for Android and iOS. And if all the above doesn't blow you away yet, there's more. To make sure their implementation is secure, they are running a <a href="https://telegram.org/crypto_contest">crypto challenge</a> and the winner will get $200,000 in Bitcoin currency. Now that's serious.</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2013</span>
    <hr>

    <p>Hyde is a brazen two-column <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It&#39;s based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, the Jekyll butler.</p>

<h3>Built on Poole</h3>

<p>Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
<li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
<li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
<li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
<li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hyde features</h3>

<p>In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support</li>
<li>Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout">reverse</a> (right sidebar), available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes">Eight optional color schemes</a>, available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme">Head to the readme</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3>Browser support</h3>

<p>Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2013</span>
    <hr>

    <p>I needed to hit a number of files on a remote HTTP server with an index ranging from 1 to 150 and my first instinct was to use wget with some sort of a loop (bash script seemed like the most logical thing to do).</p>

<p>Then I realized that I can do the same thing in a simple oneliner using 'curl'</p>

<p>It's super easy using the following info:</p>

<p>
```bash
<br />
You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:</p>
<p>http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>
<p>or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:</p>
<p>ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt<br />
ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading zeros)<br />
ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p>
<p>Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:</p>
<p>http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>
<p>You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner<br />
in the specified order.</p>
<p>You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:</p>
<p>http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt<br />
http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>

    <p>Every time a start session is called using Flurry SDK, a new session is registered <strong>unless</strong> the call was made within 20 seconds [for the same user] of the previous call, in which case these consequent sessions simply extend the existing one.</p>

<p>For Google Analytics, it is different. Google Analytics will group hits (any analytics API call you make is considered a hit in Google analytics) that are received within 30 minutes of one another [for the same user] into the same session.</p>

    <p>Here's how to use Vim as a handy HEX editor:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open the file in Vim.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Run the command to convert</strong>
<p><strong>:% ! xxd</strong></li>
<li><strong>Edit all you need (i to get into insert edit mode)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once done, run to convert back</strong>
<p><strong>:% ! xxd -r</strong></li>
<li><strong>Save (it's :wq)</strong></li>
</ol>

    <p>Microsoft’s strategy should not be to produce a better phone or tablet or to be the best mobile content provider. It cannot out-Apple Apple.</p>
