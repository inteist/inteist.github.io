This is great, but some things should just be in a good IDE. Like built in SVN integration. Seriously, why do I need to install a plugin for something so basic? Netbeans is another great IDE, but I use it less as most my development environments come from dedicated Eclipse plugins and while it is possible to do the development in Netbeans it is not as convenient and straightforward and this is what we the pragmatic programmers usually prefer.</p> <p>So one nice thing I got used to in Netbeans is how it colors the changes that I made in the editor if the file is under version control (e.g. SVN). After I used Netbeans for a while and got to like this feature, when I got back to Eclipse I kinda missed it. It's nice and convenient. Quite non obtrusive i.e. it doesn't get in your way - you may not even be noticing this if you don't know about it.</p> <p>Anyways, turns out that it is quite easy to enable similar functionality for Eclipse, alas you have to have SVN plugin I suppose for the "diff" to work. Just follow the screenshot if you want to enable coloring of SVN changes in Eclipse similar to Netbeans.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585" title="eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff" src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff.png" alt="" width="628" height="337" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <p style="text-align: left;">Here's how it will look (you can change colors if you want)</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-589" title="eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result" src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result.png" alt="" width="285" height="115" /></a></p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-power-of-snapdragon-processor-with-adreno-gpu"> The Power of SnapDragon Processor With Adreno GPU </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2011</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>Very energizing and inspiring video about Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor with the Adreno GPU.

The general idea seems to be that various applications will be able to share data and communicate otherwise not really disclosing too much about their functionality.</p> <p>It is exciting news yeah, but why does it so painfully reminds me of Android "intents" system? To me it is exactly the same. Although some sources say it has some ideas similar to what former Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie’s proposed as the “universal clipboard” concept — dating back to 2006. I still find it hard to see how this is different from Android's intents system. It would be interesting to watch who sues who over that if at all. The huge piles of patents Google and Microsoft have do not make much sense to go to war over this.</p> <p>It is interesting though to see how one of the most important features/ideas of Android OS gets propagated into other operating systems.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/google-io-2011-is-approaching"> Google I/O 2011 Is Approaching! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">04 May 2011</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>I am one of the lucky people who managed to snatch a ticket to Google I/O this year.

It's been some time I wanted to give it a try and understand why so many people rave about it but every time I needed to use it, I usually wanted to do something very simple and sometimes I just got overwhelmed by all the options and sometimes I just didn't want to invest а lot of time into figuring out how to "use" TextMate beyond the most basic stuff.</p> <p>One of the options I missed and couldn't find an easy way to do was to go to the last edit. After some searching however I did find a plugin that does that. You can <a href="http://email.eva.mpg.de/~bibiko/downloads/textmate/TMGoToLastEdit.tmplugin.zip">download the go to last edit plugin for TextMate</a> plugin and once you install it, you will have the "go to last edit" awesomeness in your TextMate. Use the<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;"><strong>⌥⌘J</strong><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;"> combination to activate the plugin. It uses the "undo/redo" mechanism but this particular plugin solves some problems that some other apple scripts or other solutions that use undo/redo technique had.</span></span></p> <p>Enjoy this plugin and enjoy TextMate, although I actually like my MacVim better for most of the stuff I wanted to use TextMate for :). And actually I find Netbeans to be very good for JS, I started using TextMate for JS, but now I almost exclusively use Netbeans. Share your thoughts, opinions and experience  with TextMate plugins and with Mac editors in general in the comments.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/blackberry-os-distribution-marchapril-2011"> BlackBerry OS Distribution March/April 2011 </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2011</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>Just got an email from RIM with news and such and noticed the link to the OS center they run on their website to help developers choose which BB OS to target. After looking at the stats, I decided to make a comparison and see how the official stats from RIM differ from what I see within my applications.</p> <p>Here's the distribution published by RIM (dated March 3-d) I am not sure what they compiled into the March 3-d, i.e. what the timestamp of March 3-d actually means. Was it based on OS tracked for March 3-d, was it for last month, week or such.

But again, the official statistics are pretty much 2 month old now and actually since the rest of the sections pretty much coincide with the official statistics, I would assume that the number of OS 5.0 just got larger in these 2 month; which by itself is great news for BB developers. Hooray to that and I will try to keep up with statistics to see how the distribution shifts, maybe another post in couple month or when something interesting happens.
