He presented on the Foursquare's usage of <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, a rapidly gaining popularity NoSQL database. Quickly - the idea behind NoSQL database that it is not based on a relational model as most traditional databases but rather on a document model.</p> <p>Harry had many interesting things but the one thing that was especially interesting to me was that they <strong>basically run all the DB operations of FourSquare in RAM! </strong>Yes that's right. They employ the extra large memory instances on EC2, running with 64GB or RAM and they shard whenever they start approaching certain limits of RAM.</p> <p>The outages they had in early October were because they hit the memory limit and the databases started to page in and out the data from the hard drives to the memory and back and this quickly brought them down.</p> <p>He mentioned that this is however not Mongo's fault and this would have happened with any database they would have used. Which is interesting by itself because it means that the way the application is engineered - the requirements is that all the data that they operate has to be in RAM for the application to be fast enough. I bet there is a lot of smart engineers working at Foursquare and there has to be a good reason for that and in fact Harry mentioned that they basically have to have almost all the checkins available in memory due to the nature of the queries they have to perform on the data.  He also mentioned that when (this seemed more of a "when" rather than "if") they move to dedicated servers with solid state drives, they should not have that limit anymore because then the hard drives (SSDs) in that case will be fast enough.</p> <p>For me all this was very surprising and I am still a little puzzled about it and wonder whether there is/was no way of engineering the application so that they don't have to keep pretty much all their data (about 5 million users and 160 million checkins at the moment), all in RAM.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bit.ly/e0p3b4" target="_blank">Slides of the presentation</a></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>UPDATE (Dec 15 2010) a few related links:</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2010/10/05/so-that-was-a-bummer/">Official blog from Foursquare</a></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769761">Interesting discussion at YCombinator hacker news</a></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a href=" http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/1265191137/foursquare-mongodb-outage-post-mortem">Some notes of Alex Popescu from NoSQL blog</a></p> <p style="text-align: left;"> <p style="text-align: left;"> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>UPDATE (Dec 17 2010) - 10gen posted the video of the meetup</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong> </strong><a href="http://www.10gen.com/video/misc/foursquare">MongoDB and Foursquare video</a></p> <p><!-- This script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon as the line is read by the browser.

While these tests are definitely subjective since they are performed by RIM, so they could choose website favorable to the PlayBook and otherwise objectively-subjectively give the PlayBook some edge, the interesting thing to note is that the PlayBook uses the open source WebKit browser initially developed by Apple.

So what is QNX?</p> <div></div> <p>Below are some notes from the session delivered for developers right after the tablet was introduced during the keynote speech at the DevCon2010.</p> <div>QNX - is a highly distributed, self healing POSIX compliant, real time operating system.</div> <div></div> <p>Real time here basically means preemptive partitioning, which in turn means patented scheduling mechanism for dynamic resource allocation. Here we are talking about CPU as the main resource.</p> <div></div> <p>Self Healing - since the system is based on POSIX - message passing, only the core kernel (0.1 million lines of code in total, compared to 70+ million lines in Windows and 9+ million lines in Linux kernels) and the process manager are at the core, all the other processes, can be hot restarted. The key issue here to take home is that QNX is highly modular system unlike the much more monolithic Windows and Linux systems. The monolithic kernel only consists of the microkernel and the process manager - a small partition of all OS code which can be highly optimized and is easier to monitor for bugs. All the rest of the OS systems are "hot pluggable" modules which run in their own processes and can be restarted without taking down the whole system. This is the main point of QNX being highly resilient system and the term used by Dan Dodge the co-founder and the CEO of QNX systems - self healing.</p> <div></div> <p>QNX will support Adobe mobile Air and Flash for start and is fully capable of running the Java JVM which should enable the table to run any Java applications written with native BlackBerry SDK for OS 6.0 (and probably anything above level 6.0 SDK). There is also an option of a native C/C++ development for QNX. Momentics - the native developer environment - an Eclipse plugin. QNX is apparently company #3 to join the Eclipse project early on - at the Eclipse 1.0 stage and the main contributor to the C/C++ CDT project. The Momentics environment has a rich set of tooling for coding, debugging and profiling the natively written applications for the QNX.</p> <p>If you are interested in the latest updates, you should head to the following resources:</p> <div> <ul> <li>The official <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/tablet.jsp" target="_blank">blackberry resource for the developers interested in tablet OS</a></li> <li>The official <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flash/blackberrytabos/" target="_blank">Adobe resource for the developers interested in BlackBerry tablet OS</a></li> </ul> </div> <p></div> </div> <div> <ul></ul> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> </div> </div></p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/android-expands-support-for-paid-application-to-more-countries-and-developers"> Android Expands Support for Paid Application to More Countries and Developers </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>In a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>, Google announced that it is significantly expanding payment support both for developers and the users.</p> <p>Developers in 29 countries will be able to sell their apps and users from 32 countries will be able to buy paid apps.
