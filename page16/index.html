So what is QNX?</p> <div></div> <p>Below are some notes from the session delivered for developers right after the tablet was introduced during the keynote speech at the DevCon2010.</p> <div>QNX - is a highly distributed, self healing POSIX compliant, real time operating system.</div> <div></div> <p>Real time here basically means preemptive partitioning, which in turn means patented scheduling mechanism for dynamic resource allocation. Here we are talking about CPU as the main resource.</p> <div></div> <p>Self Healing - since the system is based on POSIX - message passing, only the core kernel (0.1 million lines of code in total, compared to 70+ million lines in Windows and 9+ million lines in Linux kernels) and the process manager are at the core, all the other processes, can be hot restarted. The key issue here to take home is that QNX is highly modular system unlike the much more monolithic Windows and Linux systems. The monolithic kernel only consists of the microkernel and the process manager - a small partition of all OS code which can be highly optimized and is easier to monitor for bugs. All the rest of the OS systems are "hot pluggable" modules which run in their own processes and can be restarted without taking down the whole system. This is the main point of QNX being highly resilient system and the term used by Dan Dodge the co-founder and the CEO of QNX systems - self healing.</p> <div></div> <p>QNX will support Adobe mobile Air and Flash for start and is fully capable of running the Java JVM which should enable the table to run any Java applications written with native BlackBerry SDK for OS 6.0 (and probably anything above level 6.0 SDK). There is also an option of a native C/C++ development for QNX. Momentics - the native developer environment - an Eclipse plugin. QNX is apparently company #3 to join the Eclipse project early on - at the Eclipse 1.0 stage and the main contributor to the C/C++ CDT project. The Momentics environment has a rich set of tooling for coding, debugging and profiling the natively written applications for the QNX.</p> <p>If you are interested in the latest updates, you should head to the following resources:</p> <div> <ul> <li>The official <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/tablet.jsp" target="_blank">blackberry resource for the developers interested in tablet OS</a></li> <li>The official <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flash/blackberrytabos/" target="_blank">Adobe resource for the developers interested in BlackBerry tablet OS</a></li> </ul> </div> <p></div> </div> <div> <ul></ul> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> </div> </div></p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/android-expands-support-for-paid-application-to-more-countries-and-developers"> Android Expands Support for Paid Application to More Countries and Developers </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>In a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>, Google announced that it is significantly expanding payment support both for developers and the users.</p> <p>Developers in 29 countries will be able to sell their apps and users from 32 countries will be able to buy paid apps.

They are still trying to cater to weird enterprise scenarios and impress developers with these capabilities. RIM has to wake up and realize that the number of developers caring about enterprise features declines exponentially.</div> <div></div> <div>Same as with the networking which is a pure hell because there are at least 7 different ways to establish a network connection, they are trying to cater to different scenarios and have all these different ways of doing pretty much the same thing in 5 ways. Seriously - <strong>WHY??? </strong>Just give us <strong>one </strong>but <strong>RELIABLE</strong> way of doing something. Don't you get it that we - the developers don't want to implement something in more than one way and then debug it forever or yet, to have to implement something in 3 ways because you are not sure (and don't really have a good way of telling) which way will work for every specific user. You have to start repeating this every day as your daily mantra - the simpler it is, the less it breaks. This is a universal engineering fact. Would you please already get this?

I have arrived to San Francisco at noon today and just had a relaxing day browsing the sity, visiting the beautiful Chinatown and the Coit Tower from where you can see pretty much the whole city. It's my second time in San Francisco, first time being here about 1.5 years ago for the Google I/O 2009 (so sorry had to miss it this year...). San Francisco is an interesting city and I like it, but it is a little dirty for my snobby Bostonian taste.</p> <p>Anyhow, this is not about the city. BBDevCon 2010 is tomorrow and I am expecting it to be a turnkey for me, it was a long time of [intlink id="75" type="post"]love and hate relation[/intlink] between me and BlackBerry. The platform is not evolving (yeah yeah, BB OS 6 - whatever... this is so 3 years ago) and in the super fast paced space as mobile, standing still is actually equals to moving back as everyone is innovating with the speed of light.</p> <p>I will be looking for cues as to whether RIM will be able to at least [intlink id="285" type="post"]maintain its current user base[/intlink] and improve his ways in treating smaller indie developers.</p> <p>There have been rummors about BB Tablet - BlackPad, to be announced during the BB DevCon 2010. I am personally very skeptical about it, but we will see. Also - it is almost clear to everyone that RIM will announce it's advertising API availability to the public - not great news though. They have the worst performing advertising so far, and this is one of the major points for me personally, if there is no promising (I am not even wishing for bright) future on the horizon, BlackBerry will be the last platform to receive any attention on my list.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/facebook-is-down-funny-tweets-collection"> Facebook Is Down - Funny Tweets Collection </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p style="text-align: left;">Apparently today Facebook was down for 2 hours and for some even more...

The learning curve for BlackBerry development is very steep, which makes it a huge hurdle for the newcomers to the platform, but works for the advantage of the companies and developers who already took the plunge and were swimming the quirky waters of BlackBerry OS for some time.</p> <p><!--more-->So basically what I am saying is that for existing BlackBerry developers is it a very sweet spot to be in <strong>if</strong> BlackBerry OS is to there to stay. With less than 10 thousand apps on the app world compared to more than 150 thousand on Android and more than 250 thousand on iPhone, there is a good chance your app will get noticed and get traction; especially if your app is somewhat polished since many of the apps on BlackBerry at the moment look absolutely horrible.  But the if I mentioned earlier about BlackBerry staying in the game, at least long enough for developers to rip any benefits <strong>in indeed one big if</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Is RIM in trouble? </strong>Yes, I think it certainly is.</p> <p>My contemplations began a long ago and I keep finding more and more reinforcements to this as time goes by, or maybe just more and more people are starting to realize it now as the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-earnings-preview-now-rim-needs-to-explain-why-the-blackberry-isnt-screwed-2010-9" target="_blank">revenues of RIM are plummeting</a> and the market share is shrinking instead of growing with the overall growth of the smartphone market share. It surely does not look good anyway you look at it.</p> <p>The upcoming BlackBerry developer conference seem to be struggling to find audience as well, as I have been getting tons of emails with more and more steep discounted registration fees, to the extent when it seems they will soon start actually paying people to attend.</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-android-blackberry-2010-8" target="_blank">recent find</a> to the collection was this article on business insider about how noone gives a damn about BlackBerry OS:</p> <ul> <li><strong>No one who buys BlackBerry products actually cares about the BlackBerry OS.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>RIM's greatest assets are its email service (on BlackBerry phones and back-end server setup), BlackBerry Messenger, and the BlackBerry brand. </strong>These could all be moved over to Android, and none of them relies on the BlackBerry OS.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>RIM's mobile app platform is garbage compared to Apple's or even Google's.</strong> An Android BlackBerry would be able to take advantage of the fast-growing Android app platform, and RIM wouldn't have to waste any money nurturing it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>RIM still has good relationships with most carriers.</strong> So an Android-based BlackBerry could receive top billing from carriers, versus rival Android devices from Motorola, HTC, Samsung, and others.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>If RIM joined the Android camp, it would be a HUGE boost for Android, and a big problem for Apple, which would lose even more platform share to Android.</strong> Developers might seriously have to start thinking about Android first, and Apple's iOS second. (There are still some major problems with Android's app market, but those can be worked out.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>For illustration, if RIM were an Android vendor in Q2, Android would have had 35% of the world's smartphone market, per IDC, versus Apple's 14%. </strong>Instead, RIM had 18% -- down from last year -- and Android had 17% -- up huge from last year.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Doesn't a BlackBerry Droid sound sexy to you?</strong></li> </ul> <p>The article may come as a joke to some, but if you think about it and you know [intlink id="75" type="post"]realities of development on different platforms[/intlink], this actually starts to make a lot of sense.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page17">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page15">Newer</a> </div> </div> </body> </html>
