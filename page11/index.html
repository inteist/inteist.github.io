    <p>If you want to remove XCode on OS X (aka Developer Tools) you can do the following:</p>

<p><strong>If installed from the developer portal:</strong></p>

<p><code>sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools –mode=all</code></p>

<p><strong>If installed via App Store it should be:</strong></p>

<p><code>sudo /Library/Developer/Shared/uninstall-devtools –mode=all</code></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
To be able to install Developer Tools from the App Store, you need to delete Install XCode from your /Applications folder
something like this should work:</p>

<p><code>sudo rm -Rf /Applications/Install Xcode.app</code></p>

<p>Then once you download the Xcode from the App Store, it is not installed yet. You need to go to the same place /Application/Install Xcode.app and run the installer.</p>

    <p>Last year I've put some stats for BB OS distribution here: [link id='540']</p>

<p>Beginning 2012 I was wondering what is the OS distribution now with the BB OS 7.0 devices in the wild and especially since I wanted to do updates only for the devices running BB OS 5.0 and up.</p>

<p>So the distribution looks like this:</p>

<p><a src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-639" title="BB-OS-distribution" src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="343" /></a></p>

<p>Making devices that run OS below 5.0 to be about 5-6% of all the devices. Of course this data is based on the users who use this specific app, but I am almost positive that this is pretty close to the generalized numbers.</p>

<p>The numbers look like this:<br />
<a src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers.png"><img src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers.png" alt="" title="BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers" width="622" height="331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" /></a></p>

    <p>Here's the chart of smartphones market share according to market research firm <a href="http://www.npd.com">NPD</a></p>

<p>Quite interesting trend can be seen by the end of the year with huge spike in iOS sales. This of course can be attributed to the iPhone 4S and the holiday season. Apple products are still considered luxury and make great gifts as opposed to say Android which is considered more of a necessity.</p>

<p><a src="http://inteist.com/media/iOS-vs.-Android-vs.-BlackBerry-vs.-Windows-Phones.png"><img src="http://inteist.com/media/iOS-vs.-Android-vs.-BlackBerry-vs.-Windows-Phones.png" alt="" title="iOS vs. Android vs. BlackBerry vs. Windows Phones" width="617" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-630" /></a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br />
Additional source (showing the same trend though) from <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/more-us-consumers-choosing-smartphones-as-apple-closes-the-gap-on-android/">Nielsen</a><br />

    <p>An interesting infographics was published on the <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2012/01/11/windows-phone-2011-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank">WP7 developer blog</a>.</p>

<p>The most interesgint points that we saw are that 56% of the users can purchase apps via carrier billing which is amazing number for a young platform. Android did not have carrier billing for at least a year into its existence if not two years. Which was a significant barrier for selling paid apps since billing mechanism was not oiled like on Apple's iOS platform where all the users have iTunes setup with their billing information.</p>

<p>Surprising enough the Games category is not as huge as we'd expect it to be. Taking a little smaller percentage than the Entertainment apps in the app to category distribution. But in the paid apps category Games are far ahead of any other category in purchases which of course should not be surprising, although this trend is not so prominent on other platforms.</p>

<p>Overall it seems pretty good info and quite useful for developers. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>If you are using Chrome and Firefox and well pretty much any other popular browser, you are used to switching tabs with CMD+number which switches to the desired tab e.g. CMD+1 will switch to the first tab (including the pinned ones for Chrome). This however does not work for Safari.</p>

<p>For safari to cycle between tabs use <strong>CMD+SHIFT+Left/Right</strong></p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2012</span>
    <hr>

    <p>If you were playing with the "Live Tiles" from the latest (at the moment) OS update to the Windows Phone code named "Mango", you might have been wondering what makes Live tiles unique and how many live tiles can be placed on the home screen of the user. Accidentally I found out that what makes the live tile unique is the tile reference or the tile URI</p>

<p>a usual way to create a tile would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="n">ShellTile</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Uri</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/GotoPage.xaml?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2, UriKind.Relative), tileData);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>so whenever you change the value1 and value 2, a new live tile can be created.</p>

<p>Happy coding and have fun with the live tiles!</p>

    <p>If you are getting the:</p>

<p><strong>"failed to connect to device as it is pin locked"</strong></p>

<p>when trying to deploy your app to a windows phone 7 device no worries. Just make sure to disable the "screen lock" or "screensaver" whatever it is called. That's what it is all about!</p>

<p>I was lucky to figure this one immediately but if you got here means you got stuck with it and had to look it up. Hopefully this will help you with that problem.</p>

    <p>If you are getting an error similar to the error below while trying to install and/or update BlackBerry SDK as a plugin for Eclipse</p>

<p><code><br />
An error occurred while collecting items to be installed session context was:<br />
(profile=AppceleratorProfile, phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.Collect, operand=, action=).<br />
Unable to read repository at:<br />
Unable to read repository at https://swdownloads.blackberry.com/Downloads/auth/contactFormPreload.do?code=<br />
...<br />
</code></p>

<p>You are in luck!</p>

<p>Your problems are over as you found the solution. All you need to do is to clear the "Secure Storage" contents. To do that go to</p>

<p><strong>Windows -> Preferences</strong></p>

<p>Type <em>secure</em>, drill down to find the <em>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.repository</em>, expand this, and you will see the <em>swdownloads.blackberry.com</em>. Select this entry and delete it. This should resolve the issue next time you try to update/install the plugin you should be asked again for your credentials to the BlackBerry developer portal and once you put them in the installation should proceed normally.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here's how it looks in Eclipse:<br />

    <p>Eclipse is a great tool that I have been using for mmm... wow (!!!) probably about 7 years now and the most amazing thing about it is of course all the plugins that can really extend the functionality of the basic editor and make it highly personalized. This is great, but some things should just be in a good IDE. Like built in SVN integration. Seriously, why do I need to install a plugin for something so basic? Netbeans is another great IDE, but I use it less as most my development environments come from dedicated Eclipse plugins and while it is possible to do the development in Netbeans it is not as convenient and straightforward and this is what we the pragmatic programmers usually prefer.</p>

<p>So one nice thing I got used to in Netbeans is how it colors the changes that I made in the editor if the file is under version control (e.g. SVN). After I used Netbeans for a while and got to like this feature, when I got back to Eclipse I kinda missed it. It's nice and convenient. Quite non obtrusive i.e. it doesn't get in your way - you may not even be noticing this if you don't know about it.</p>

<p>Anyways, turns out that it is quite easy to enable similar functionality for Eclipse, alas you have to have SVN plugin I suppose for the "diff" to work. Just follow the screenshot if you want to enable coloring of SVN changes in Eclipse similar to Netbeans.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here's how it will look (you can change colors if you want)</p>
