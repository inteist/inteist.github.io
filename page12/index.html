Of course this data is based on the users who use this specific app, but I am almost positive that this is pretty close to the generalized numbers.</p> <p>The numbers look like this:<br /> <a src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers.png"><img src="http://inteist.com/media/BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers.png" alt="" title="BB-OS-distribution-by-numbers" width="622" height="331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" /></a></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/ios-vs-android-vs-blackberry-vs-windows-phones"> iOS vs. Android vs. BlackBerry vs. Windows Phones </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2012</span> <p>Here's the chart of smartphones market share according to market research firm <a href="http://www.npd.com">NPD</a></p> <p>Quite interesting trend can be seen by the end of the year with huge spike in iOS sales. This of course can be attributed to the iPhone 4S and the holiday season. Apple products are still considered luxury and make great gifts as opposed to say Android which is considered more of a necessity.</p> <p><a src="http://inteist.com/media/iOS-vs.-Android-vs.-BlackBerry-vs.-Windows-Phones.png"><img src="http://inteist.com/media/iOS-vs.-Android-vs.-BlackBerry-vs.-Windows-Phones.png" alt="" title="iOS vs. Android vs. BlackBerry vs. Windows Phones" width="617" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-630" /></a></p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br /> Additional source (showing the same trend though) from <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/more-us-consumers-choosing-smartphones-as-apple-closes-the-gap-on-android/">Nielsen</a><br /> ***Note the shift in timeline.

Android did not have carrier billing for at least a year into its existence if not two years. Which was a significant barrier for selling paid apps since billing mechanism was not oiled like on Apple's iOS platform where all the users have iTunes setup with their billing information.</p> <p>Surprising enough the Games category is not as huge as we'd expect it to be. Taking a little smaller percentage than the Entertainment apps in the app to category distribution. But in the paid apps category Games are far ahead of any other category in purchases which of course should not be surprising, although this trend is not so prominent on other platforms.</p> <p>Overall it seems pretty good info and quite useful for developers.

Accidentally I found out that what makes the live tile unique is the tile reference or the tile URI</p> <p>a usual way to create a tile would be:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="n">ShellTile</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Uri</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/GotoPage.xaml?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2, UriKind.Relative), tileData);</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>so whenever you change the value1 and value 2, a new live tile can be created.</p> <p>Happy coding and have fun with the live tiles!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/wp7-deployment-error-failed-to-connect-to-device-as-it-is-pin-locked"> WP7 Deployment Error: Failed to Connect to Device as It Is Pin Locked </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2012</span> <p>If you are getting the:</p> <p><strong>"failed to connect to device as it is pin locked"</strong></p> <p>when trying to deploy your app to a windows phone 7 device no worries.

This is great, but some things should just be in a good IDE. Like built in SVN integration. Seriously, why do I need to install a plugin for something so basic? Netbeans is another great IDE, but I use it less as most my development environments come from dedicated Eclipse plugins and while it is possible to do the development in Netbeans it is not as convenient and straightforward and this is what we the pragmatic programmers usually prefer.</p> <p>So one nice thing I got used to in Netbeans is how it colors the changes that I made in the editor if the file is under version control (e.g. SVN). After I used Netbeans for a while and got to like this feature, when I got back to Eclipse I kinda missed it. It's nice and convenient. Quite non obtrusive i.e. it doesn't get in your way - you may not even be noticing this if you don't know about it.</p> <p>Anyways, turns out that it is quite easy to enable similar functionality for Eclipse, alas you have to have SVN plugin I suppose for the "diff" to work. Just follow the screenshot if you want to enable coloring of SVN changes in Eclipse similar to Netbeans.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585" title="eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff" src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff.png" alt="" width="628" height="337" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <p style="text-align: left;">Here's how it will look (you can change colors if you want)</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-589" title="eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result" src="http://inteist.com/media/eclipse-enable-svn-quick-diff-result.png" alt="" width="285" height="115" /></a></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-power-of-snapdragon-processor-with-adreno-gpu"> The Power of SnapDragon Processor With Adreno GPU </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2011</span> <p>Very energizing and inspiring video about Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor with the Adreno GPU.

Yey! Hopefully some users will realize that we (the developers) are not the ones to blame (most of the time) that Facebook integration suddenly stopped working. Hopefully the ones that realize this will stop giving bad ratings on App Store and Android Market because of that.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page13">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page11">Newer</a> </div> </div> <!-- Google Analytics --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-2630485-14', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
