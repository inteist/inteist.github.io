    <h2>Preface</h2>

<p>At some point in the past I was trying to monetize free application on BlackBerry and since most of the advertising networks that actually work with BlackBerry don't have an SDK, I had to work with their WEB APIs directly.</p>

<p>This did not work for me at all (with minor exception for Quattro Wireless). Maybe this was personal to me, I don't know, probably not. The monetization through advertising on BlackBerry is unfortunately does not work. I am talking from a lot of experience supporting free applications with ads on Android and iOS.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time looking for advertising agencies working with BlackBerry and then signing up and then getting the necessary information from them and then working through their documentation to implement a custom web client to pull the info from their web APIs - all this to learn once again that<strong> the revenue I could get is a </strong><strong>joke</strong>.</p>

<h2>Quattro Wireless</h2>

<p>Advertising with Quattro Wireless actually turned out to be the best BlackBerry advertising experience I had so far... As long as it lasted (not very long unfortunately).</p>

<p>Starting Sept. 30 1020 Quattro is iAd exclusive and stopped serving any ads to BlackBerry. Since I do not ever trust what I can get from advertising service, when the service stopped, the application was not impacted but other developers that were less careful (something you should not ever do though) might have had some problems.</p>

<h2>NexAge</h2>

<p>NexAge left me with<strong> the</strong> <strong>worst</strong> <strong>impression </strong>of all. First these guys at NexAge took a hell lot of my time with manual sign up and many  many phone calls I had to have with them to get anywhere. It looked very suspicious to me that they can't implement an automatic sign up and to actually sign up for the service you had to talk to them over the phone. I should have known better at this point. Coupled with their awfully looking website, this fact should have stopped me from moving forward with them and saving a lot of my time and frustration. But since there were not many options at a time, I decided to try them out. The interesting part is that when I voiced my concerns about the manual sign-up to some higher up developer relations manager, he told me "We are the BMW of advertising, we give you a personalized and best service out there"... yeah... right...  After signing up with them and integrating their code (there were a few hiccups on the way but nothing deal breaking) I started to serve their advertisements and the results were - well... simply put horrible. When I talked to them they were not really helpful and they kept saying "we will investigate and will try to optimize". I wonder if they are optimizing the ads manually as the sign-up. After couple weeks of my pilot with them, during which I wrote them and called them to complain about the ridiculousness of the revenue with not much results (they mostly simply ignored me) I shut them down and decided to forget about them and about the partial revenue I have generated in these couple weeks for the sake of my own mental health. I have to point out that they did have an SDK - a ridiculously large SDK, so I decided that I can not add an SDK which is almost as much as half of my whole application size, especially while I can implement the same thing with couple classes.</p>

<h2>SMAATO</h2>

<p>With <strong>SMAATO</strong> everything was much simpler, but the revenue was as bad if not worse as with NexAge. After trying them for some time and not seeing any improvement, I gave up on them.</p>

<h2>MillennialMedia</h2>

<p>With Millenial, it was more complicated. At some point I was simply furious with them and if there were any other options to advertise on BlackBerry, I would definitely avoid them, but since there aren't I still work with them in a very limited capacity. I was so so sorry to learn that they are going to handle the technology side of RIM's advertising service. The reason is simple - they are SUPER unorganized. And coupled with RIM, they just doubled the amount of mess. For example, they say you are ready to serve ads and you are fully operational and you publish your app and then you see some super weird stats and you ask them and they tell you some BS and then you wait a little more and then you ask again and then a few weeks later they say - "Ohh the ads you were serving are test ads". To make things even worse - this happened to me more than once.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, unfortunately, if you want to monetize your free application on BlackBerry - you better prepare yourself for the worst. I was hoping the official RIM advertising service will solve this problem, but unfortunately it didn't. It's a complete mess, as I mentioned and I don't think they are going to sort this out any time soon. If you are a developer that knows of a better service - please let me know, I would appreciate it. Hopefully my experience also helps you to save some of your time. If you are eager to try anyway, I plan to post the custom integration code that I wrote here so that you (again) can save some time reusing this code.</p>

<p>I have been to a presentation by Harry Heyman - the first non founder employee of Foursquare. He presented on the Foursquare's usage of <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, a rapidly gaining popularity NoSQL database. Quickly - the idea behind NoSQL database that it is not based on a relational model as most traditional databases but rather on a document model.</p>

<p>Harry had many interesting things but the one thing that was especially interesting to me was that they <strong>basically run all the DB operations of FourSquare in RAM! </strong>Yes that's right. They employ the extra large memory instances on EC2, running with 64GB or RAM and they shard whenever they start approaching certain limits of RAM.</p>

<p>The outages they had in early October were because they hit the memory limit and the databases started to page in and out the data from the hard drives to the memory and back and this quickly brought them down.</p>

<p>He mentioned that this is however not Mongo's fault and this would have happened with any database they would have used. Which is interesting by itself because it means that the way the application is engineered - the requirements is that all the data that they operate has to be in RAM for the application to be fast enough. I bet there is a lot of smart engineers working at Foursquare and there has to be a good reason for that and in fact Harry mentioned that they basically have to have almost all the checkins available in memory due to the nature of the queries they have to perform on the data.  He also mentioned that when (this seemed more of a "when" rather than "if") they move to dedicated servers with solid state drives, they should not have that limit anymore because then the hard drives (SSDs) in that case will be fast enough.</p>

<p>For me all this was very surprising and I am still a little puzzled about it and wonder whether there is/was no way of engineering the application so that they don't have to keep pretty much all their data (about 5 million users and 160 million checkins at the moment), all in RAM.</p>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->Android – Can’t Find my ADB
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Dec 2010</span>

    <p>Just installed the new Android SDK - 2.3 and wondering where's "ADB"? Don't worry it's there.</p>

<p>In there recent release of the Android 2.3 codenamed "Gingerbread" the SDK's directory was a little restructured. In particular the ADB (Android debug bridge) the tool that is used to communicate with the Android emulator instances and connected device has been moved. Previously you could find it in the</p>

<blockquote><p>path_to_your_Android_SDK_installation<strong>/tools</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>folder.</p>

<p>But since the Android 2.3 (or API 9) the /<strong>tools</strong> folder was renamed to /<strong>platform-tools </strong>folder, so if you are wondering why suddenly your <em>&gt;adb </em>command does not work - this is the reason and updating the PATH should fix it.</p>

    <h3><strong>Problem:</strong></h3>

<p>You are getting the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>android Error generating final archive: Debug certificate expired on ...</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>One day when you opened your Eclipse with Android tool chain installed, suddenly you see this error, which may seem weird because you know that Eclipse uses just some random certificate for debugging and so why is it expired and what to do.</p>

<h3><strong>The Solution: </strong></h3>

<p><strong></strong>Simply delete the keystore file which is located in</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>%USERHOME%/.android/debug.keystore</strong> (on Windows)</p></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>~/.android/debug.keystore </strong>(on Linux and OS X)</p></blockquote>

<p>Restart your eclipse and you are all set.</p>

<h3><strong>Why this happens</strong>:</h3>

<p>The reason to this is that the debug certificate is set to expire every year or 365 days.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to be bothered by this again in a year, you can use the <strong>keytool</strong> executable from the Android tool chain to generate a certificate with a longer expiration period.</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Nov 2010</span>

    <p>In the following video, the web experience on the BlackBerry Playbook is compared to the web experience on the iPad. It is clearly shown (the video is made by RIM) that PlayBook significantly outperforms the iPad. While these tests are definitely subjective since they are performed by RIM, so they could choose website favorable to the PlayBook and otherwise objectively-subjectively give the PlayBook some edge, the interesting thing to note is that the PlayBook uses the open source WebKit browser initially developed by Apple. It is a very interesting camparo nevertheless.</p>

<p>Would be very interesting to see the Samsung Galaxy Tab running Android participate in this comparison, especially since it has the same 7" form factor as the PlayBook and it has Flash enabled of course.</p>

<p>Enjoy the video and let me know what you think!</p>

    <p>After recent upgrade to my DokuWiki installation (I jumped from <strong>Mulled Wine </strong>straight to the latest release - <strong>Anteater</strong>)</p>

<p>I was getting this weird error:</p>

<blockquote><p>call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]: First argument is expected to be a valid callback, 'Doku_Renderer_metadata::section_edit' was given</p></blockquote>

<p>the solution was to disable all the plugins and re-enable them again. Not sure why it worked, but it worked and the error is gone now! So if you experience the same error - try this. If it doesn't help, another good idea could be gradually re-enable plugins and see which one is the offender. Good Luck!</p>

    <p>This is a great comics I came across, very  concise and true!</p>

<p>I especially liked the dinosaur. BlackBerry are dinosaur outdated both in the features and especially from the development perspective. I covered this before in my [intlink id="75" type="post"]Android vs. BlackBerry development post[/intlink].</p>

    <p>Today, at the annual PDC10 conference, Microsoft is showing love for its developers and promoting its coming Windows Phone 7 by giving all the attendees a free Windows Phone 7. This follows in the steps of similar giveaways by Google at Google/IO 2009 and Goole/IO 2010, Motorola and Adobe giveaway at Adobe Max 2010. With many companies following Google's example, Google so far is by far the leading company on these giveaways.</p>

<p>Microsoft is expected to spend more than 400 millions on the promotion of its Windows Phone 7 . Here's hoping that registered and published developers will get a free phone or at least discounted phones since as of now, it is quite hard to get your hands on a a phone and this is obviously crucial to testing the apps in real live scenarios, on real hardware.</p>

    <p>I needed recently to basically remove my app installation from the Windows Phone 7 emulator. I could not find how you can remove the app from the emulator, but I found a way to reset and force the Windows Phone 7 emulator to cold boot.</p>

<p>You can clear the windows phone emulator state, by deleting the saved state file in:</p>

<blockquote><p>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\XDE\*.dess</p></blockquote>

<p>You can just hit the windows key on your keyboard and paste this "%ProgramData%\Microsoft\XDE\" and you will be taken to the right location.</p>

<p>Delete the *.dess files. This will force the emulator to reset and run the cold boot sequence.</p>

<p>Too bad, it's not possible to do simulator reset right from the development tools. Here's hoping that Windows Phone Tools development team will improve that situation in the future releases.</p>

<p>Please share your thought in comments.</p>

<p>So, as you probably already know, the coming BlackBerry table will be powered by the QNX pronounced almost like Unix - "ku-nee-ks". So what is QNX?</p>
<div></div>
<p>Below are some notes from the session delivered for developers right after the tablet was introduced during the keynote speech at the DevCon2010.</p>
<div>QNX - is a highly distributed, self healing POSIX compliant, real time operating system.</div>
<div></div>
<p>Real time here basically means preemptive partitioning, which in turn means patented scheduling mechanism for dynamic resource allocation. Here we are talking about CPU as the main resource.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Self Healing - since the system is based on POSIX - message passing, only the core kernel (0.1 million lines of code in total, compared to 70+ million lines in Windows and 9+ million lines in Linux kernels) and the process manager are at the core, all the other processes, can be hot restarted. The key issue here to take home is that QNX is highly modular system unlike the much more monolithic Windows and Linux systems. The monolithic kernel only consists of the microkernel and the process manager - a small partition of all OS code which can be highly optimized and is easier to monitor for bugs. All the rest of the OS systems are "hot pluggable" modules which run in their own processes and can be restarted without taking down the whole system. This is the main point of QNX being highly resilient system and the term used by Dan Dodge the co-founder and the CEO of QNX systems - self healing.</p>
<div></div>
<p>QNX will support Adobe mobile Air and Flash for start and is fully capable of running the Java JVM which should enable the table to run any Java applications written with native BlackBerry SDK for OS 6.0 (and probably anything above level 6.0 SDK). There is also an option of a native C/C++ development for QNX. Momentics - the native developer environment - an Eclipse plugin. QNX is apparently company #3 to join the Eclipse project early on - at the Eclipse 1.0 stage and the main contributor to the C/C++ CDT project. The Momentics environment has a rich set of tooling for coding, debugging and profiling the natively written applications for the QNX.</p>
