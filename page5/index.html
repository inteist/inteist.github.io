    <p>BlackBerry Developer conference is starting tomorrow. I have arrived to San Francisco at noon today and just had a relaxing day browsing the sity, visiting the beautiful Chinatown and the Coit Tower from where you can see pretty much the whole city. It's my second time in San Francisco, first time being here about 1.5 years ago for the Google I/O 2009 (so sorry had to miss it this year...). San Francisco is an interesting city and I like it, but it is a little dirty for my snobby Bostonian taste.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this is not about the city. BBDevCon 2010 is tomorrow and I am expecting it to be a turnkey for me, it was a long time of [intlink id="75" type="post"]love and hate relation[/intlink] between me and BlackBerry. The platform is not evolving (yeah yeah, BB OS 6 - whatever... this is so 3 years ago) and in the super fast paced space as mobile, standing still is actually equals to moving back as everyone is innovating with the speed of light.</p>

<p>I will be looking for cues as to whether RIM will be able to at least [intlink id="285" type="post"]maintain its current user base[/intlink] and improve his ways in treating smaller indie developers.</p>

<p>There have been rummors about BB Tablet - BlackPad, to be announced during the BB DevCon 2010. I am personally very skeptical about it, but we will see. Also - it is almost clear to everyone that RIM will announce it's advertising API availability to the public - not great news though. They have the worst performing advertising so far, and this is one of the major points for me personally, if there is no promising (I am not even wishing for bright) future on the horizon, BlackBerry will be the last platform to receive any attention on my list.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Apparently today Facebook was down for 2 hours and for some even more... I did not pick up long time on this since I do not use Facebook, but just accidentally I wanted something and I tried to load it and boom I got:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2010-09-23-at-4.47.09-PM1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-294 aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="Screen shot 2010-09-23 at 4.47.09 PM" src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2010-09-23-at-4.47.09-PM1.png" alt="" width="477" height="180" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Not sure whether this is a localized event I went to twitter to see if others had this problem and man I was in for some good laughs. Here's the collection of funniest tweets during the time that the Facebook was down:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Ant check out the Twitter trends. How "DNS Failure" sounds to you as a trend - huh?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>UPDATE: </strong> Apparently it wasn't just my "original" idea to collect funny tweets, many other websites did so as well, what is interesting that there are about 20-30 different tweets overall which just keep repeating from site to site. Are we short of funny twitter-ers? People obviously do care. Maybe they are just afraid Facebook coming after them in revenge? (just kidding of course, or am I?). Let me know what you think in comments.</p>

    <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>For the last several month I've been thinking about the future of developing for BlackBerry and whether it even makes sense to bet on the BlackBerry OS. The learning curve for BlackBerry development is very steep, which makes it a huge hurdle for the newcomers to the platform, but works for the advantage of the companies and developers who already took the plunge and were swimming the quirky waters of BlackBerry OS for some time.</p>

<p><!--more-->So basically what I am saying is that for existing BlackBerry developers is it a very sweet spot to be in <strong>if</strong> BlackBerry OS is to there to stay. With less than 10 thousand apps on the app world compared to more than 150 thousand on Android and more than 250 thousand on iPhone, there is a good chance your app will get noticed and get traction; especially if your app is somewhat polished since many of the apps on BlackBerry at the moment look absolutely horrible.  But the if I mentioned earlier about BlackBerry staying in the game, at least long enough for developers to rip any benefits <strong>in indeed one big if</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Is RIM in trouble? </strong>Yes, I think it certainly is.</p>

<p>My contemplations began a long ago and I keep finding more and more reinforcements to this as time goes by, or maybe just more and more people are starting to realize it now as the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-earnings-preview-now-rim-needs-to-explain-why-the-blackberry-isnt-screwed-2010-9" target="_blank">revenues of RIM are plummeting</a> and the market share is shrinking instead of growing with the overall growth of the smartphone market share. It surely does not look good anyway you look at it.</p>

<p>The upcoming BlackBerry developer conference seem to be struggling to find audience as well, as I have been getting tons of emails with more and more steep discounted registration fees, to the extent when it seems they will soon start actually paying people to attend.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rim-android-blackberry-2010-8" target="_blank">recent find</a> to the collection was this article on business insider about how noone gives a damn about BlackBerry OS:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No one who buys BlackBerry products actually cares about the BlackBerry OS.</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>RIM's greatest assets are its email service (on BlackBerry phones and back-end server setup), BlackBerry Messenger, and the BlackBerry brand. </strong>These could all be moved over to Android, and none of them relies on the BlackBerry OS.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>RIM's mobile app platform is garbage compared to Apple's or even Google's.</strong> An Android BlackBerry would be able to take advantage of the fast-growing Android app platform, and RIM wouldn't have to waste any money nurturing it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>RIM still has good relationships with most carriers.</strong> So an Android-based BlackBerry could receive top billing from carriers, versus rival Android devices from Motorola, HTC, Samsung, and others.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>If RIM joined the Android camp, it would be a HUGE boost for Android, and a big problem for Apple, which would lose even more platform share to Android.</strong> Developers might seriously have to start thinking about Android first, and Apple's iOS second. (There are still some major problems with Android's app market, but those can be worked out.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>For illustration, if RIM were an Android vendor in Q2, Android would have had 35% of the world's smartphone market, per IDC, versus Apple's 14%. </strong>Instead, RIM had 18% -- down from last year -- and Android had 17% -- up huge from last year.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doesn't a BlackBerry Droid sound sexy to you?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The article may come as a joke to some, but if you think about it and you know [intlink id="75" type="post"]realities of development on different platforms[/intlink], this actually starts to make a lot of sense.</p>

    <p>It is simple to load a BlackBerry application packaged as cod file to your device using JavaLoader.exe. With JavaLoader, you do not have to install the desktop manager if you just want to have an ability to quickly load applications to your blackberry</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect your BlackBerry to your computer through USB</li>
<li>Open command prompt and navigate to the location of JavaLoader.exe</li>
<li>Run <code>JavaLoader.exe -u=USB load path_to_your_cod_file</code> command and you should be all set</li>
</ol>

<p>It is easier if you have the JavaLoader and the COD files in the same dir because then the command is simply</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">JavaLoader.exe -u<span class="o">=</span>USB load path_to_your_cod_file
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The JavaLoader command will not work if you don't have the BlackBerry desktop manager installed. You will get an error that the port can not be open.</p>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->The future of GPU computing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>It seems that GPU computing is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Tools are becoming better and better, the applications are becoming wider and wider and the hardware is becoming faster and faster too.</p>

<p>CPU are steadily gaining in productivity. It's a steadily rising curve. Is it good news though? Depends how you look at it. It's good that the speeds and efficiency are improving, but apparently CPUs  are improving much slower than GPUs. GPUs computational power for suitable problems (like number crunching) was apriory much higher to start with, but what's really important is that GPUs are moving much faster i.e. the curve of the speedup is much sharper than that of CPUs.</p>

<p>For about $500 you can get the Nvidia GTX 480 right now with 400+ cores and super fast memory. GPUs in general also require much less space and power and thus are in general much more efficient for heavy number crunching computations than CPUs. Of course GPUs are quite limited in their capabilities and are really suitable for specific tasks, but there are more and more areas where people are starting to employ the power of highly parallel GPU computing with lightweight threads.</p>

<p>There is another caveat with GPU - it's the slow bus connection. The bus is too slow for the speeds of GPU and there is nothing you can do about it at the moment. One thing that can be done since GPU has so much computing power in parallel, is to compress the data that is passed between the GPU and the rest of the system. 1 to 10 ratio is the standard compression ratio of text, so you can increase the throughput of the bus by a factor of 10 using compression. Of course there is still some overhead and you should make an experiment and see whether this is beneficial in your setup.</p>

<p>Overall though, it seems pretty exciting area at the moment and the true technoratis should definitely pay attention to that area.</p>

    <p>It's been long advocated by software developer luminaries that you have to "eat your own dog food" which means you have to use the software you are producing as extensively as possible to realize the shortcomings and things that are broken. This is the "I am not a fish" category as explained by Seth in the series of the following 3 videos. Extremely valuable series for anyone dealing with user experience.</p>

    <p>If you have "can't locate tools.jar" error when trying to run "ant", you've come to the right place. The fix is apparently very easy, you have to properly set up the "JAVA_HOME" environment variable to Java JDK. The <strong>tools.jar</strong> is found in the bin folder of the JDK but you only need to point the JAVA_HOME to your JAVA SDK installation and you should be all set!</p>

<p>Easy, right? Go get them!</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 May 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>If you've been experiencing horrendous performance of Eclipse on OS X, or maybe you even did not know that Eclipse actually can run very fast, you'd be surprised to learn that apparently it is very easy to make Eclipse run 4-5 times faster  on OS X with proper settings to your eclipse.ini file.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">First I will give you a bit of  background. If you want the gist of it or how to make it fly - just go the end of the post.  So a few days ago, PSU fried on my main desktop development machine. It is a newer Quad Core i5 2.6 machine with 4GB 1066Mhz memory and a standard 7200 RPM drive. Since the machine is dead and I am waiting for a replacement power supply, I had to move to my new and shiny MacBook Pro, which I have recently purchased and which is from the latest batch of the updated MacBooks and is quite powerful. It is also i5 (only dual core though) with the same 4GB of 1066Mhz memory and 5400 HD.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2010-05-28-at-1.41.40-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-242 aligncenter" style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="Screen shot 2010-05-28 at 1.41.40 AM" src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2010-05-28-at-1.41.40-AM.png" alt="" width="242" height="62" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, yeah, I would say that the systems are pretty close right. Nevertheless, working with Eclipse on OS X felt horrendously slow! I had already noticed this nuance in the past and I thought that the Eclipse is just not meant to fly on Mac-s (oh well...), especially when there are so many different distributions for OS X, it signals that the project is in a shifting phase basically (it is shifting from Carbon to Cocoa) and that you should expect all kinds of problems.</p>

<p><!--more--><br />
I bet many people not having experience with Eclipse on other platforms would think this is normal. It's Java, so it is supposed to be slow and they just go and hate it and sing how X-Code is great. The thing is, they probably never experienced the full potential of Eclipse - a pity. Hopefully this post can change your mind and help you experience the wonderful world of Eclipse (ok, I am being a little dramatic here). Ok, let's dive into that.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Since I am pretty heavy user of Eclipse [intlink id="75" type="post"]developing both for Android and BlackBerry[/intlink] the slowness of Eclipse quickly grew on me and I started looking for ways to try and do something about it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the past while experiencing slowness with Eclipse on Windows, I played with the memory allocation within it to increase the memory cap and this usually helped a bit. Being desperate, I decided to try that and off I went to try that. But, that was not so easy. I wandered a bit around the eclipse folder looking for the location of the eclipse.ini but it was nowhere to be found. So I tried searching for it - nop, no luck there as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Apparently eclipse.ini is packaged </strong>inside the eclipse app so what you need to do is to get inside the eclipse.app package</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-244 aligncenter" style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="Opening Eclipse app package contents on OS X 10.6" src="http://inteist.com/media/Screen-shot-2010-05-28-at-2.58.31-AM.png.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="114" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">after that edit <strong>eclipse.ini </strong>which you will find in Contents-&gt;MacOS folder<strong> </strong>and increase the memory limits for the following directives:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">-Xms***m
-Xmx***m
</code></pre></div>
<p>replace the *** with whatever memory you think should work for you as a rule of the thumb, just try to double it at first.</p>

<p>While this is good, this is NOT what will actually make your Eclipse fly. The most important part here is the:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion<span class="o">=</span>1.5
</code></pre></div>
<p>now, you have to switch that to 1.6 and make it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion<span class="o">=</span>1.6
</code></pre></div>
<p>
Now THAT will make your Eclipse really shine! Just make sure you actually HAVE the JDK 1.6 installed. You can validate this by running "<em>java -version</em>" in the terminal. If you got 10.6 - Snow Leopard though, you are most likely covered.</p>

<p>
If you already had that in the eclipse.ini file - well, unfortunately this already has been optimized for you and the only thing you can try from there that we know of is to play with the memmory limits.</p>

<p>

    <p>I've got the Motorola Droid from Google through their device seeding program a while ago. Which is nice although Nexus One would be much better since then I would have been actually using as my phone. The Droid has to be tied to Verizon and I am a T-Mobile lad all the way.</p>

<p>Anyways, I've tried a few times to get adb debugging talk to my Droid on my Win7 64 bit and I could not get it to work for a long long time. I tried to search around for the solution, but none of the drivers that I've found worked until today I started the search again and found the Win7 64 bit Droid drivers from Motorola <a href="http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/USB_Drivers/Handset_USB_Driver_64/" target="_blank">here</a> which worked perfectly fine!</p>

<p>Don't forget to go to "Settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;Development" and enable "USB Debugging"</p>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>People that are fascinated by Apple usually don't look around for other things, they like the polished products that just work. But for other people and technologists it's not like that. We usually are looking for the best tool for the job. So my point here is that not many Apple fans even heard of Chrome OS. Yes, they probably heard about Chrome browser (and this was <strong>very</strong> smart move by Google by the way, first to release the browser by the same name for many reasons, but one reason is that people are getting used to the Chrome web experience).</p>

<p>Anyways, the question that I really wanted to address here is: was the development of Chrome OS and the Chromium project in general a response to the iPhone OS thread and the coming (now released) iPad or maybe it was exactly the other way around?</p>

<p>So Google started <strong>actively</strong> working on the Android OS about 2 years ago while iPhone was already available but doing the first baby steps. The pace of development of Android was quite fast and at the moment these rival operating systems  are somewhat comparable in futures stability and usability. Some are lacking on Android and some are lacking on the iPhone. Last year Google started working on the Chrome OS which is essentially an operating system inside the browser and just about a month ago Apple released the iPad to the public. While there are already a few tablets running on spin offs of Android OS, Google is rumored to be soon releasing its own tablet and what it will run is yet unclear.</p>

<p>Anyway however, it seems that Google is targeting the same space that the iPad does right now with its Chrome OS. Simple operating system. Or is it an operating system and can it be compared with the iPhone OS which is actually an operating system. Very limited at that but still. If the Chrome OS would be the strictly in browser OS it is questionable how it will stack up against iPad. Users are used to having free access to their file system and being able to install software rather than use webapps. In that sense the iPad is revolutionizing and laying out the ground for the change of computing paradigm we got used to so far.</p>

<p>It is not clear what came first (as the concept) and what was developed first but it would be sure very interesting to watch this evolution of computing in the near future.</p>

    <p>If you were wondering whether you can use  apache licensed code in your commercial applications and what do you need to do in order to comply with the license here's the unofficial simple ans short answer.</p>

<p><strong>You can use Apache 2.0 licensed source code in your project as long as you include the copy of the license in your distribution and provide attribution in an applicable way in your distribution. </strong></p>

<p>The slightly lengthier and detailed (but still very simple explanation) is below, taken from <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html" target="_blank">Apache license FAQ</a></p>

<p><!--more-->Describing legal documents in non-legalese is fraught with potential     for misinterpretation.  Notwithstanding the text that follows, the     actual text of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html#License">license</a> itself is legally     binding and authoritative.</p>

<p>That said, here's what the Apache license says in layman's terms:</p>

<p>It <strong>allows</strong> you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>freely download and use Apache software, in whole or       in part, for personal, company internal, or commercial purposes;</li>
<li>use Apache software in packages or distributions that       you create.</li>
</ul>

<p>It <strong>forbids</strong> you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>redistribute any piece of Apache-originated software       without proper attribution;</li>
<li>use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in       any way that might state or imply that the Foundation endorses       your distribution;</li>
<li>use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in       any way that might state or imply that you created the Apache       software in question.</li>
</ul>

<p>It <strong>requires</strong> you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>include a copy of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html#License">license</a> in any       redistribution you may make that includes Apache software;</li>
<li>provide clear attribution to The Apache Software Foundation       for any distributions that include Apache software.</li>
</ul>

<p>It <strong>does not require</strong> you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>include the source of the Apache software itself, or of any       modifications you may have made to it, in any redistribution       you may assemble that includes it;</li>
<li>submit changes that you make to the software back to the  Apache       Software Foundation (though such feedback <em>is</em> encouraged).</li>
</ul>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->Using Amazon S3 to serve JAD files for BlackBerry OTA distribution
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>If you don't want the preamble of why I wanted to serve JAD files from Amazon S3, skip to the second paragraph.</p>

<p>I have recently came across the need to push OTA update of the <a href="http://www.comitic.com/blackberry/dailyhoroscope-application/" target="_blank">DailyHoroscope application for BlackBerry</a>. I conjectured that OTA updates have different behavior and thus different impact on the web server. There are still many people using their smartphones in general and BlackBerries in particular over the slower EDGE connections as opposed to 3G, not to mention 4G and/or WiMax. So to download 300K file over EDGE connection in the real usage example can take anywhere between 10 seconds to couple minutes. All this time the webserver's thread serving this specific client will remain running. So it seems like you (or rather your server) can be in a nasty situation when 1000 users simultaneously or almost simultaneously decide to do the OTA update. Also quick calculation with Amazon WS calculator shows that serving files from S3 would be rather cheap even comparing to renting a cheap VPS for that purpose. My estimate was that the whole upgrade process (considering the fact that almost all the users update from S3) will cost me about $15. And this is independent of the time span. For $15 you could get a very cheap VPS for one month (if you are lucky). So it seemed like a no brainer. It indeed was until I faced a few problems with setting this up which I will cover here so that you don't have to spend much time looking for solutions if you want to do the same.</p>

<p>Setting up S3 is a breeze. Using it - not so much. It is just like any other service pretty much - when you want to sign up and call sales you are answered immediately but if you have a problem and need customer service, well, you can be on hold quite a while. If you have Amazon account already set up, you can use this account. You will have the option to opt for the payment to any of the payment options (now it seems that this is only credit cards) already on file with Amazon or you could add a new credit card so that your S3 bill is billed separately.</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>When you signed up, you are almost ready to begin using S3. Once you receive confirmation email which can take a few minutes until your request is processed and billing information verified, you are set to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/account/" target="_blank">Amazon account dashboard</a> and login with your Amazon account you had or just created</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Security Credentials</strong></li>
<li>Under the <strong>Access Credentials</strong> table, look at the first tab - <strong>Access Keys</strong></li>
<li>Next to your access key, will be a column <strong>Secret Access Key </strong>which will have the secret key hidden from the screen.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Show</strong> and your secret access key will be revealed</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can use this information to log in to S3 and start uploading files. To access S3 you can use S3Fox from any platform since it is FireFox plugin. You can use <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">CyberDuck </a>if you are on Mac which is an excellent free general purpose FTP client which also supports WebDav and SFTP. If you are on Windows, there is also free and feature rich client <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/?page=cloudberry-explorer-amazon-s3" target="_blank">CloudBerry</a>. S3Fox is very nice and fast and you do not have to install anything on the system, only plugin for FireFox, but I will be using CloudBerry since we will need to set custom Content-Type for the JAD and COD files and CloudBerry is more feature rich than S3Fox.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open CloudBerry</li>
<li><strong>Enter your credentials</strong> and open your S3 account</li>
<li><strong>Create a bucket</strong> - it has to have unique system wide name like a domain name (actually subdomain, because after it is created it is references by http://yourUniqueName.s3.amazonaws.com)</li>
<li>Enter into the bucket and <strong>create folders, or just upload the files</strong> you want to serve. If you like me want to serve OTA BlackBerry application, you probably want to create a separate folder for each release</li>
<li>After you create the folder, use the ACL (access control levels/list) menu button <a src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-acl-button.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-213" style="border: 0pt none;" title="cloudberry-acl-button" src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-acl-button.png" alt="" width="43" height="30" /></a>to open the ACL controls</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-acl-controls1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-210 aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="cloudberry-acl-controls" src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-acl-controls1.png" alt="" width="469" height="129" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<ul>
<li>Using the ACL controls, give <strong>"Read" access to "All Users</strong>" (note that if you place  check mark on the bottom "Apply for all subfolders and files" the  permissions will propagate down the tree)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the whole world can read the files you uploaded. The problem with BlackBerry OTA distribution is that Amazon does not send the right mime-types in the HTML Content-type header. And this is something that you will need to get fixed before people can actually install your application over the air directly from S3.</p>

<p>The right content types for the the JAD and COD are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div>jad -  <strong> text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</strong></div>
</li>
<li>
<div>cod - <strong>application/vnd.rim.cod</strong></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So using the custom HTTP headers menu button <a src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-for-s3-menu-butto.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-216" style="border: 0pt none;" title="cloudberry-custom-http-headers-for-s3-menu-butto" src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-for-s3-menu-butto.png" alt="" width="131" height="32" /></a> we will be setting those types for JAD file and <strong>all </strong>the COD files respectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select your JAD file and click on "Set HTTP Headers" button</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get the custom HTTP headers dialog:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-217 aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog" src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog.png" alt="" width="507" height="198" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>"Content-Type"</strong> field and replace it with the <strong>text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</strong> for the value</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can repeat the above step for each COD file individually, or you can select all the COD files and set the headers at once but then you would need to add the <strong>"Content-Type" </strong>header manually for the right COD mime type - <strong>application/vnd.rim.cod</strong>.<strong> </strong>Just use "Add" and in the HTTP-Header enter "Content-Type" and in the Value enter "application/vnd.rim.cod". You should see something like the following dialog</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog-manual-add-filled.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-220 aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog-manual-add-filled" src="http://inteist.com/media/cloudberry-custom-http-headers-dialog-manual-add-filled.png" alt="" width="504" height="442" /></a></p>

<p><strong>***IMPORTANT to check the "Keep existing headers" </strong>or you will loose all your default defined headers which is not good in most cases.</p>

<p>That's it, you are DONE! Check that you did everything right by pointing your BB browser to http://yourUniqueName.s3.amazonaws.com/yourReleaseFolder/AppName.jad and make sure that you can install the application from there. If you did everything right it should work.</p>

<p>Overall S3 seems like a very nice (and apparently very cheap) service and anyone who serves lots of static content should consider using it for that purpose. But not everything seems so pink in the world of S3 and I am sure you will face many other small problems and nuances while setting it up as I did for my task. But hopefully if serving BlackBerry application is all you want, you should now have everything to get you started.</p>

    <p>The next version of the BlackBerry Eclipse plugin will fix most of the [intlink id="75" type="post"]annoying things about blackberry development[/intlink].</p>

<p>Some of the most important things are:<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>1) No need to restart emulator for new build to be loaded to the emulator (Hallelujah!!!)</strong></p>

<p>The<strong> </strong>new build should be just loaded onto the already started simulator, pretty much as on Android and iPhone.</p>

<p><strong>2) Ability to add external libraries i.e. <em>*.jar</em> files to the project</strong></p>

<p>This is actually pretty peculiar since RIM was pushing hard 3-d party (external library) integration as one of important concepts and obviously it would be very beneficial for the BlackBerry ecosystem but if you did not want to use JDE, there was pretty much no clean way to add external library. That is until the 1.1 plugin comes out from beta, or at least that what was promised at the [intlink id="167" type="post"]New England BlackBerry developers meetup[/intlink].</p>

<p><strong>3) The BlackBerry plugin would follow the "Eclipse way"</strong></p>

<p>The 1.1 plugin is very different from previous version. Instead of following the "JDE way" it will be much more the natural "Eclipse way". This is both good and bad. This is very good for developers that have experience with Eclipse and just now start to develop for BlackBerry. This will however be somewhat painful for the seasoned developers who got used to the old plugin and will need to discover many things from scratch. (I personally felt quite lost with the new 1.1 plugin and decided to stick with the old one until 1.1 comes out of beta).</p>

<p>You can download the beta of 1.1 from <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/devbetasoftware/javaplugin.jsp" target="_blank">here</a> (you would need to have BlackBerry developer account which is <strong>free</strong> and can be obtained with simple sign up immediately)</p>

    <p>During the [intlink id="136" type="post"]Super App webcast[/intlink] Mike Kirkup covered many questions from the attendees. I have gathered many of those in the webcast summary. He did not get through all of the questions and promised to answer all of the questions on <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Development/ct-p/BlackBerryDevelopment" target="_blank">blackberry development forum</a>. He did just that and here is the Q&amp;A extracted:</p>

<p><strong>[Q] The problem I found with a super app that was tightly  integrated with the address book is that people were looking to see an  icon and not something that was just part of the existing BlackBerry UI.</strong></p>

<p>[A] A good point.  Many users will still expect a simple icon for the  application whether only to provide information on how to leverage the  application or how to manipulate settings.  Fixmo is a really good  example of this point.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Is there a way for my app to get notified when new  notifications are shown on the device?</strong></p>

<p>[A] Unfortunately, no.  But this sounds like a great feature request  you should log via the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/issuetracker" target="_self">BlackBerry Issue Tracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Is there a way to include full camera control in the  application?</strong></p>

<p>[A] Yes.  Check out JSR 135 (MMAPI) for more information on how to  include the camera field within your application including the ability  to modify zoom and flash settings.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] With the definition of a "Super App" being one that you  cannot live without, can a game be a super app?</strong></p>

<p>[A] Great question!  Yes, a game definitely can be a "Super App" or  take on many of the characteristics of a Super App including being  notification driven, contextual (even location based), integrated with  other applications and so on.  It isn't hard to imagine having a game  that you love so much that you can't live without it.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Can I make a Super App by developing a BlackBerry Widget?</strong></p>

<p>[A] Yes, definitely.  One of the most important attributes of the our  Widget technology is that you can fully integrate your Widget into all  of the same APIs that are available to Java applications whether exposed  already through Javascript APIs or through your ability to write  Javascript to Java APIs.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Do you plan on setting up a program to certify  applications as Super Apps?</strong></p>

<p>[A] No, we do not currently have any plans for certifying  applications as a Super App today.  The concept here is to help people  really understand not only the capabilities of the BlackBerry platform  but also the possibilities on better engaging your users.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] We have developed a collaboration application which works  on a "pull" basis.  How can we leverage push?</strong></p>

<p>[A] Check out our newly launched <a rel="nofollow" href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/javaappdev/pushapi.jsp" target="_self">Push Services page</a> for more  information on how you can start leveraging push in your application  whether for the enterprise or consumers.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Is it possible to add a custom menu item in any third  party application? </strong></p>

<p>[A] Yes, although not in a granular fashion today.  As part of the  ApplicationMenuItem API you can specify that you want your menu item  included in all applications on the device but you do not get to pick  which applications if you don't want all apps.  Can you submit a feature  request in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/issuetracker" target="_self">Developer Issue Tracker</a> if you think this is a good  use case.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] Suppose the application flow is such that screen 1 pushes  screen 2, screen 2 pushes screen 3 and from screen 3 the user needs to  go to screen 1.  Should the application push screen 1 again or pop  screens to get to screen1?</strong></p>

<p>[A] You should definitely maintain the proper ordering of the screens  on the stack for the user such that your application will automatically  pop off the top screen on the stack when the user presses the escape  key.  So, in this case, it depends on your ultimate goal of the screens.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] This is a great presentation but it gives very little to  seasoned developers.  Will you have additional presentations with more  details and more code samples? (Editor: <em>this, I think is actually my question slightly rephrased</em>)<br />
</strong></p>

<p>[A] Yes, definitely.  This is the introduction to the concept of  Super Apps and you will see additional webinar presentations that go  into substantially more detail on all of the key aspects of bringing  Super Apps characteristics to your application.  The Big Ideas, Little  Screens UI Webinar from Brian this month is a perfect example of more  involved webinars.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] What are the OS or device requirements for the Javascript  examples provided?</strong></p>

<p>[A] These are part of the new <a rel="nofollow" href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/devbetasoftware/widgetsdk.jsp" target="_self">BlackBerry Widget technology</a> and  require v5.0 handheld software.</p>

<p><strong>[Q] You mentioned the Super Apps website.  Where is that?</strong></p>

<p>[A] <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/superapps" target="_self">www.blackberry.com/developers/superapps</a></p>

<p>He also promised to keep posting answers so see the original forum thread <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/BlackBerry-Super-Apps-Webinar-Follow-up/td-p/466845" target="_blank">here</a> for more information</p>

    <p>You may need to know your iPhone or iPod Touch device ID (or UUID or also known as UDID) for many reasons. Whatever reasons those are there are couple of very easy ways to find out what is your iPhone or iPod Touch device ID.</p>

<h3>Mac or Windows:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Connect the device to your Mac or PC.</li>
<li>On the "Summary"  tab in iTunes, click the "Serial Number" label.  You'll notice "Serial  Number" changes to "Identifier".</li>
<li>Click on "Edit" in the menu  at the top and select "Copy".</li>
<li>Now you can paste the device ID  into an email.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Mac + XCode</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start XCode</li>
<li>Go to "Organizer"</li>
<li>In the "Summary"  tab you will see the connected iPhone or iPod Touch's ID under the "<strong>Identifier</strong>"</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also a free Hmm UUID app that will show you your iPhone or iPod Touch device id.</p>

    <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>I've just read a post at Coding Horror - Jeff Atwood's popular blog where he goes into the problem that many candidates applying for a programming job simply can not program. He claims that it's almost all of the applicants, which I find hard to believe. I tend to think that their resume evaluation techniques are just not good enough, which is surprising since Jeff is good friends with Joel Spolsky who had an interesting article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SortingResumes.html" target="_blank">screening resumes</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, Jeff's article is not about that. It's about a little nifty tool that will allow you to see other person type. It's very simple you give your interviewee a link and open a link in your browser and can see everything the other person types with a couple seconds lag. This tool is definitely nice, but hell, why not just use google wave? It's easy, many technical people should already have it. If the programmer applying doesn't have it and doesn't have a good reason as to why this is so you should think twice about putting further time and effort in the interview process.</p>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->New England BlackBerry Developer Meetup group - first meetup notes
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>Last night I have attended local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-England-BlackBerry-Developers/" target="_blank">New England BlackBerry developer meetup group</a>. It was a great event with nice turnout of about 50 developers with special guest - Mike Kirkup - director of developer relations at RIM.</p>

<p>Mike is a great speaker and a great guy in general. BlackBerry developers are truly blessed with Mike in that sense. So much has been done to ease up on the [intlink id="75" type="post"] hurdles of BlackBerry development[/intlink] recently that it is becoming cool to be BlackBerry developer once again.</p>

<p>The meetup was hosted by a local software development company - <a href="http://www.softartisans.com" target="_blank">SoftArtisans</a>. They develop <a href="http://silverdust.softartisans.com">SharePoint solutions for BlackBerry</a>.</p>

<p>Mike was give the stage and he went over the BlackBerry super app concept which was similar to the [intlink id="136" type="post"]BlackBerry super app concept webcast[/intlink] he gave recently but a little different of course with some stuff oriented more towards developers.</p>

<p>The highlight was of course the free panel Q&amp;A session which was afterwards. Mike, as usual, did a very nice job answering the questions of the many developers who brought up interesting questions.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Products</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/business/server/express/" target="_blank">BES Express</a> (or BESX) which is the <strong>free</strong>, striped down version of the BES server. This will allow smaller businesses to put their employees on BESX without hesitation which originated from the costs of licensing associated with putting employees on BES.</li>
<li>[intlink id="168" type="post"]Upcoming WebKit browser[/intlink] which will be <strong>blazing fast</strong> and <strong>super blazing fast</strong> for JavaScript.</li>
<li>There will be no iPad like device.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>"No iPad, no BlackPad, BluePad, RedPad etc..."</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Advertising APIs. Right now RIM is conducting a closed beta with their partners and should be soon available to all independent developers. There is no cap on the volume, meaning pretty much anyone would be able to integrate advertising in their apps.</li>
<li><a href="http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/03/introducing-blackberry-push-services-to-developers/" target="_blank">Push APIs</a> (well this is not an upcoming event actually, it went live today at 9am). Push API is available to everyone now and is <strong>free!</strong></li>
<li>App World 2.0 will soon be launched. The next version of the app world will support not only the PayPal but also the carrier and credit cards. The share of developers will most likely be different across all the optios and across the different network operators as well. PayPal option will remain 20/80% split with 80% going to the developers.</li>
<li>In a few weeks the new Eclipse plugin for BlackBerry development version 1.1 should be released, which will address many issues existing in the older 1.0 browser. The official release of 1.1 which should go out of beta will be fully supporting 64 bit systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>

<ul>
<li>Very soon we would have "fast simulator experience" so painful to many developers that when announced, it was followed by applause storm. So fast simulator experience means no more restarting the simulator to load the newly compiled version. (Yey!)</li>
<li>More aggressive promotion of the App World. Mike mentioned that RIM intentionally kept the App World low profile for the first year letting the carriers figure out their distribution strategies.</li>
<li>Super App competition. The super app competition will be carried out with a different prize distribution model than previously. RIM decided instead of rewarding a few leading application with big bonuses, reward more developers with moderate bonuses. Mike mentioned that they expect 3000-4000 apps submitted to the contest (both new and existing apps can be submitted) and if your app passes the first criteria of actually being a super app, then you are already entitled to something. Mike threw out "a free device" in the air but I guess it is not yet decided. They may go with a free device or maybe discounted developer conference or maybe we could choose. Let us know in the comments what <strong>you </strong>would prefer. The prizes will be handed out at BB Dev Con in San-Francisco at fall and the submission deadline will most likely be July 1-st but this is not confirmed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The painful question of over the air (OTA) OS upgrade was raised and Mike said that carriers feel  fairly confident with pushing OTA OS update starting with OS 4.6 since 4.5 being the first OS where OTA OS was introduced had some issues and bugs. He mentioned that from carrier's experience OTA updates have a very high conversion rate. In the 80%-s while even the through browser+USB update is less than 20% conversion rate. Until most of the devices are 4.6 and up and carriers are more aggressive pushing updates to the devices, we will be stuck with the need to support older devices as old as 4.2.1. Which leads us to further interesting figures:</p>

<div id="_mcePaste">as of October 2009 the OS distribution is as follows:</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">4.2.1       97%</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">4.5         50-60%   - over the air update</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">4.6         30%</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">4.7         15%</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">5.0         5-6%</div>

<div>meaning supporting 4.2.1 will get you almost all the devices, while jumping to 4.5 and up will only give you about 50-60% and by going further up to 4.6, you will loose up to 30% of devices (this is due to huge number of older Curves and Pearls).</div>

<div>I will be wrapping up since this post is already quite long. Leave your thought in the comments!</div>

    <p>RIM has unveiled the new upcoming BlackBerry browser based on the new WebKit engine.</p>

<p>At the New England BlackBerry meetup, Mike Kirkup mentioned that they are doing some neat tricks with precompiling JavaScript through MDS which makes the JavaScript <strong>blazing fast</strong>. You can see it for yourself in the embedded video.</p>

<p><center><br />

</center></p>

<p>The new WebKit browser will be available in the next OS release but the upgrade will be limited on per device manner since WebKit browser is quite resource demanding.</p>

<p>Anyways, it's great news and good job RIM!</p>

    <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>Just upgraded to Firefox 3.6 and I am a little annoyed by the new "feature" of tabs opening next to the tab where you open the new tab from. While this might be convenient to some people, I got used to the "old" way of handling tabs and find myself constantly wondering where this new tab is. I might give it a few more days to see whether I get used to it but in case you are annoyed by that too and want to "fix" this here is how you can disable the new “Insert Related Tab  After Current” tweak in Firefox 3.6.</p>

<ul>
<li>Type<strong> about:config</strong> in the address bar. Then, if needed click the  “I’ll be careful, I promise!” button.</li>
<li>In the filter box – type in: <strong><em>tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent</em></strong>
<ul></ul>
</li>
<li>Right-click that <strong>about:config</strong> entry, and choose “Toggle”</li>
</ul>

<p>This will convert Firefox back to opening a new tab from a  web page on the far right of the tab bar, rather than right next to the  tab you opened it from.</p>

<p>If you decide that you actually like it and want to switch back, follow these same steps and toggle the “false” back  to “true”.</p>

    <p>I've seen this video by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>, who is without any doubt a great thinker and visioner. This presentation by Seth, besides being very informational and interesting is quite extraordinary as well. I can not remember when I've seen a better presentation lately. Great usage of visuals and associations!</p>

<p>The presentation made me think about people that are successful and people who are not. And this is absolutely true - successful people ship. I've known this for all this time, but this simple 3 words "slogan" so to say never formulated in my head. Intuitively I always felt this but after this presentation it just formed.</p>

<p>Borrowing analogy from Math, shipping is a required condition but not satisfactory, meaning that just shipping you will not necessarily make successful, but if you DO NOT ship you will most definitely NOT be successful.</p>

<p>Again, very inspiring presentation that may be an eye opener for some. Enjoy!</p>

    <div>
<p>What makes a Blackberry appliactoin to be a super app? This is the question that Mike Kirkup - head of developer relations at RIM tried to answer today in a free webcast. There has been an obsession recently with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/07/super-duper-phone/" target="_blank">super phones</a> and super apps as it seems. And why phones and/or apps have to be necessarily super?</p>
<p>So there seem to be two definitions of super apps according to Mike Kirkup.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you take the blackberry phone from the user and he misses this app - then it is a super app since it provides an inherent value for the end user.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another "definition" is more technical - so what are the main components that make a BlackBerry app a super app:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Always on experience</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Seamless integration with 3d party apps</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Notification driven</div>
</li>

<div>Not sure about you, but I see here a small misconception. On one side Mike says that if the application is extremely useful up to the point where if taken away from the user he will surely miss it but on the other hand there are specific points which actually make an app to be a super app. So what if the app is very useful to many people to the extent that they will surely miss it if taken away such as for example <a href="http://www.androidz.info/2009/07/dailyhoroscope-for-blackberry-officially-worldwide/" target="_blank">DailyHoroscope application for BlackBerry</a>. Because many users of DailyHoroscope application are going crazy and <a href="http://www.comitic.com/dailyhoroscope-recent-downtimes-exlpanation/" target="_blank">flood us with mails</a> in case we experience even minimal downtime. So the application is extremely useful to its users and certainly has value for them but according to the bullet points, DailyHoroscope is not a super app.</div>
<div>The source of confusion I think is that Mike meant if you take away <strong>BlackBerry </strong>device from the user, then other devices that may have similar apps will not be able to fill the gap. That's what makes any BlackBerry app a <strong>super app</strong> I would guess. The push mechanism and the multitasking and deep integration is something that does not exist on iPhone and/or iPod Touch, but similar things exist on Android and WebOS and Maemo are also actively developed and progressing  towards richer and richer platform.</div>
<p>So what makes specifically BlackBerry platform a super app enabler platform accodring to RIM? The first and the point which was put most of the emphasis was the “multi-threaded <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> with background apps”. Other enablers mentioned were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Contextual integration with apps</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Rich event based notification model that integrates deeply in the system</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Efficient push services</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Integrated LBS and Mapping</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike argued that the possibility of deep native integration allows easier “native” application integration in a cohesive manner into the system. The main point seems to be that since the applications do not have to invent everything from scratch by using built in components/services etc, the applications can deliver unified user experience which lowers the learning curve for the applications and eliminates most of the confusion in mastering a new app.</p>
<p>Starting from <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> 5.0 RIM introduced (or better say exposed to 3d party developers) much richer built in components such as <strong>autocomplete</strong>, <strong>file picker</strong>, <strong>map field</strong>, <strong>browserfield</strong>, <strong>media player components</strong> (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr135/" target="_blank">JSR 135</a> or MMAPI)</p>
<p>The power of push. Mike mentioned that RIM invented the push and were running it in production for more than 10 years and they know exactly what they are doing. (hear that Apple? haha... ). The push limitation for BIS is 8KB while for BES it is much higher and is specified by BES administrator but is hard limited (by I think 1MB in the older BES versions with much higher limit value in BES 5.0 - I think around 10Mb)</p>
<p>Overall it was an interesting webcast and Mike did a great job talking about all the things that are great about BlackBerry platform. I personally was a little disappointed since I expected much more technical session.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Q/A Session:</h3>
<p>Q&amp;A session was quite interesting. Mike zipped through more than 200 questions in less than 40 minutes with great and to the point answers. Thank you Mike! I documented the most interesting Q&amp;As to my taste and the ones that are most likely to be interesting to other developers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>When advertising will be available?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>For BB alliance the beta will be opening very soon. For the rest of the publishers - the time line promised by Mike was approximately 2 month</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Time for application approval?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Depends on the type of the application submitted. In general it is about 10 days but they are supposedly getting at about 48 hours time</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Is the PUSH service free for all the developers?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>It is free for almost all the alliance partners but they are working on releasing it to all the developers</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>All those super apps running in the background will make the devices slow - what about more resources for the devices?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Mike said that they will continue to innovate in the device area but the overall answer was extremely vague</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>More tutorials and code?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>There is a lot of tutorials and code currently available online but it is hard to find it. Current knowledge base will be restructured and reorganized and mostly replaced by developer resources which is some new knowledge base.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Book for developers from RIM?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Working on that with authors and the community RIM is unlikely to release the book of its own.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Developers competition for super apps? Is it something that is coming?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>RIM is planning to run super app development challenge in 4 regions very soon and pick up the best super apps and showcase them in BBDevCon in the end of September</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>When 5.0 JDE will be out of Beta?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>5.0 JDE will be out of beta soon and will finally NOT require simulator restart to push the new build to the simulator (YEY!!! Great news, hopefully Eclipse will mirror that as well)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>UI tools for <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> building</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Working on UI tool which will be drag and drop tool that will generate Java code for you (That would be a blessing, although knowing how RIM executes development tools projects, the tool might very likely be quite unusable for anything more serious than placing a label field with "Hello World")</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Paid applications worldwide timeline?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Worldwide is particularly difficult since RIM is supporting more than 150 countries. Support will be rolled out increasingly</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Is JDE going to be phased out in favor of Eclipe?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Not right now. When RIM will feel that Eclipse has matured enough it will happen, but in general Eclipse is destined to replace the JDE</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Are other development platforms going to be supported except Windows?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Mac is in the pipeline and support is likely to appear until the end of the year</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>App World is not as advertised as Apple's App Store</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Rim will start being much more aggressive about promoting App World in the future but this is highly dependent on RIMS relations with carriers since RIM is tightly integrated with carriers and they rub each other's shoulder. (well, of course...)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Payments through carriers as opposed to payment through PayPal</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>App World 2.0 will have options to pay with either credit card, PayPal or through the carrier</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Is Verizon's store going to compete with App World?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Not really as RIM is not competing with any of the 3d party stores like Handango, GetJar etc...</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Are subscription based payments going to be supported in App World 2.0?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>It is not clear exactly what it is going to be, but some sort of subscription payment will be available</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>What is the best cross framework to use for developing for BB? PhoneGap</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>PhoneGap is great but the apps built with those cross platform frameworks will not be super apps! This is not possible since those frameworks are targeting the lowest common denominator.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Suggested books?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>There are 2 good books John Wargo which is more like a reference manual. Anthony Rizk is more smooth read book and is less like reference.</div>

    <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2010</span>
    <hr>

    <p>I am using <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a> quite extensively lately to keep documentation of various things. Using wiki is quite useful in general and some people opt for using local wiki such as <a href="http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WikiPad</a> but for my needs, I opted for online wiki since I often times need to access it from various places. Maybe in the future I will post why I chose DokuWiki and some of my (objective) thoughts about comparison to other wikis and some of my likes and hates about DokuWiki (although there are much more "likes" than "hates" :) ). This post would be short and not about it.</p>

<p>Several times I just wanted to put a plain (preformatted) text into the wiki for whatever reasons but I ran into a problem that DokuWiki isn't really ready to support this. One option is to use &lt;code&gt; but then the lines are not word wrapped and for text it looks just weird. So at those various occasions I tried to search for a solution with little success until I just took xterm plugin and modified it slightly (mostly the style CSS file) which took me about 5 minutes to do  (and took me about 30 minutes to write this post, and the corresponding DokuWiki Plugin page and test the browsers) and now we have a wpre plugin for DokuWiki for word wrapped preformatted text which seem to work on all recent major browsers. You can dowload it from here<a rel="attachment wp-att-125" href="http://www.inteist.com/2010/02/word-wrapped-preformatted-text-in-dokuwiki/wpre/"> <a src="http://inteist.com/media/wpre.zip">wpre plugin for DokuWiki</a></a> (the page on DokuWiki references this file)</p>

<p>Supported browsers:</p>

<p>(I just tested whatever I had installed on my machine and all are pretty recent. I suspect many much older versions should be supported as well)</p>

<ul>
<li>FireFox 3.5.7</li>
<li>Safari 4.0.4 for Windows</li>
<li> Opera 10.10</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 8.0</li>
<li> Chrome 4.0</li>

    <p>Today many people that will open their gmail will be faced with the dialog about Google buzz. This is a new service from Google that in a sense makes your gmail inbox into twitter like account. But it is more than twitter like account. It includes conversations and embeddings from other sites like Picasa, Flickr, Youtube etc...</p>

<p>The interesting question marks that raised in my head are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Google trying to compete with huge success of Twitter? (They are not trying to compete per se, they want the realtime information that's available on Twitter and is not (yet???) available to Google.</li>
<li>Is this a step forward to <a href="http://wave.google.com" target="_blank">Google Wave</a>?</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe it's actually both 1 and 2 and something else that we can not yet see in the big picture :)</p>

<p>Google Buzz is also available on Mobile:</p>

    <p>This is more of a personal notes for myself but I am sure others will find it useful.</p>

<p><strong>Apache:</strong></p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log</strong></p>

<p>All exceptions caught by httpd, along with standard error output form CGI applications are logged here.  The first place you should look when httpd crashes, or you incur errors when accessing a website.</p>

<p><strong> /usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log</strong></p>

<p>Contains auditing information reported by suexec each time a CGI applicaiton is executed.  If you receive an internal server error, with no relevant information being reported to the Apache error_log, check here for potential suexec policy violations.</p>

<p>Domain specific access logs are located here:</p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/apache/domlogs/</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>

<p>To find out which php.ini is used for PHP configuration (to save you frustration of editing a non active php.ini) find it with the following simple command:<br />
<strong>php -i | grep php.ini</strong></p>

<p>where -i switch is used to give you PHP information (obviously). To see other useful switches run</p>

<p><strong>php -h</strong></p>

<p>to locate where php is use:</p>

<p><strong>which php</strong></p>

<p>(but you already knew this - right ? :)  )</p>

<p>*** Some of these tips are applicable not only to CentOS and cPanel configuration.</p>

    <p>As I already wrote, [intlink id="75" type="post"]BlackBerry development is not a lot of fun[/intlink].  Not only you basically can not develop in Linux and OS X (although there are some workarounds, it makes the process even more painful than it already is). But you will also have problems with 64 bit operating systems. RIM is in a position that they do not officially support 64 bit systems.</p>

<p>The main problem with 64 bit Windows 7 for me was that I can not close the simulator (or actually the "fledge" application that runs the simulators). There are 2 possible solutions to this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill the task through task manager</li>
<li>The simulator should close if you are in debug mode and you disconnect the debug session</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also another inconvenience which is caused by your cautiously guarding Windows system. It will warn you every time that (Oh my!) fledge will change something on your computer. You know - the standard User Control Account message. To avoid that message always popping up, you will have to adjust your setting in User Control Account panel. Hit "Windows" then just type UCA, you will get it. Adjust it to the minimum and you'r good to go.</p>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->BlackBerry development with Eclipse plugin – fixing corrupted *.jdp file
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2009</span>
    <hr>

    <p>It's not a secret that Eclipse plugin is very buggy and although it has improved a lot over the time, [intlink id="75" type="post"]the blackberry plugin still has a lot of issues and quirks[/intlink]. One of the problems that have been bugging me a lot was that sometimes the *.jdp file gets corrupted. This is the file where BB plugin for Eclipse saves most of the meta data for the project, including the files that are included in the project and consequently need to be compiled. So, many times I had problems with SVN meta data files corrupting this project, or sometimes perfectly legitimate *.java files that get stuck in the *.jdp file, but do not exist anymore.  The result of the *.jdp file being corrupted is that your application does no longer get compiled and redeployed when you run it. And the worst part, Eclipse would not explicitly let you know about this. It would silently fail and not re-deploy the app. So unless this is the first time you run the application, or the changes you made are not visually obvious, you would not know about this. But this is completely separate issue. One of the many issues with BB Eclipse plugin already covered.  Each time I have been struggling (sometimes for significant amount of times). Couple times I was able to manually delete files from the *.jdp file (although this is not recommended by RIM) and this solved the problem, but mostly I had to recreate the whole project from scratch, which if your project is large and, which is more important has dependencies on libraries, may become painful if you need to do this every few days.</p>

<p>So the easiest way I found so far to solve this problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the *.jdp file (you can just rename it to *.jdp.OLD)</li>
<li>Delete the project from Eclipse (right click the project and choose delete). DO NOT however check the checkbox "delete the contents of the project from disk"</li>
<li>Create a new project and point it to the same place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since all the Eclipse project related files remain untouched, you should get your project exactly at the same state it was before it got corrupted, minus the corrupted part. Why - because when you re-create the project Eclipse plugin should re-create the *.jdp file.</p>
