He claims that it's almost all of the applicants, which I find hard to believe. I tend to think that their resume evaluation techniques are just not good enough, which is surprising since Jeff is good friends with Joel Spolsky who had an interesting article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SortingResumes.html" target="_blank">screening resumes</a>.</p> <p>Anyways, Jeff's article is not about that. It's about a little nifty tool that will allow you to see other person type. It's very simple you give your interviewee a link and open a link in your browser and can see everything the other person types with a couple seconds lag. This tool is definitely nice, but hell, why not just use google wave? It's easy, many technical people should already have it. If the programmer applying doesn't have it and doesn't have a good reason as to why this is so you should think twice about putting further time and effort in the interview process.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-england-blackberry-developer-meetup-group-first-meetup-notes/"> New England BlackBerry Developer Meetup Group - First Meetup Notes </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>Last night I have attended local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-England-BlackBerry-Developers/" target="_blank">New England BlackBerry developer meetup group</a>. It was a great event with nice turnout of about 50 developers with special guest - Mike Kirkup - director of developer relations at RIM.</p> <p>Mike is a great speaker and a great guy in general. BlackBerry developers are truly blessed with Mike in that sense. So much has been done to ease up on the [intlink id="75" type="post"] hurdles of BlackBerry development[/intlink] recently that it is becoming cool to be BlackBerry developer once again.</p> <p>The meetup was hosted by a local software development company - <a href="http://www.softartisans.com" target="_blank">SoftArtisans</a>. They develop <a href="http://silverdust.softartisans.com">SharePoint solutions for BlackBerry</a>.</p> <p>Mike was give the stage and he went over the BlackBerry super app concept which was similar to the [intlink id="136" type="post"]BlackBerry super app concept webcast[/intlink] he gave recently but a little different of course with some stuff oriented more towards developers.</p> <p>The highlight was of course the free panel Q&amp;A session which was afterwards. Mike, as usual, did a very nice job answering the questions of the many developers who brought up interesting questions.</p> <h3>Upcoming Products</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/business/server/express/" target="_blank">BES Express</a> (or BESX) which is the <strong>free</strong>, striped down version of the BES server. This will allow smaller businesses to put their employees on BESX without hesitation which originated from the costs of licensing associated with putting employees on BES.</li> <li>[intlink id="168" type="post"]Upcoming WebKit browser[/intlink] which will be <strong>blazing fast</strong> and <strong>super blazing fast</strong> for JavaScript.</li> <li>There will be no iPad like device.</li> </ul> <blockquote><p>"No iPad, no BlackPad, BluePad, RedPad etc..."</p></blockquote> <ul> <li>Advertising APIs. Right now RIM is conducting a closed beta with their partners and should be soon available to all independent developers. There is no cap on the volume, meaning pretty much anyone would be able to integrate advertising in their apps.</li> <li><a href="http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/03/introducing-blackberry-push-services-to-developers/" target="_blank">Push APIs</a> (well this is not an upcoming event actually, it went live today at 9am). Push API is available to everyone now and is <strong>free!</strong></li> <li>App World 2.0 will soon be launched. The next version of the app world will support not only the PayPal but also the carrier and credit cards. The share of developers will most likely be different across all the optios and across the different network operators as well. PayPal option will remain 20/80% split with 80% going to the developers.</li> <li>In a few weeks the new Eclipse plugin for BlackBerry development version 1.1 should be released, which will address many issues existing in the older 1.0 browser. The official release of 1.1 which should go out of beta will be fully supporting 64 bit systems.</li> </ul> <h3>Upcoming Events</h3> <ul> <li>Very soon we would have "fast simulator experience" so painful to many developers that when announced, it was followed by applause storm. So fast simulator experience means no more restarting the simulator to load the newly compiled version. (Yey!)</li> <li>More aggressive promotion of the App World. Mike mentioned that RIM intentionally kept the App World low profile for the first year letting the carriers figure out their distribution strategies.</li> <li>Super App competition. The super app competition will be carried out with a different prize distribution model than previously. RIM decided instead of rewarding a few leading application with big bonuses, reward more developers with moderate bonuses. Mike mentioned that they expect 3000-4000 apps submitted to the contest (both new and existing apps can be submitted) and if your app passes the first criteria of actually being a super app, then you are already entitled to something. Mike threw out "a free device" in the air but I guess it is not yet decided. They may go with a free device or maybe discounted developer conference or maybe we could choose. Let us know in the comments what <strong>you </strong>would prefer. The prizes will be handed out at BB Dev Con in San-Francisco at fall and the submission deadline will most likely be July 1-st but this is not confirmed yet.</li> </ul> <p>The painful question of over the air (OTA) OS upgrade was raised and Mike said that carriers feel  fairly confident with pushing OTA OS update starting with OS 4.6 since 4.5 being the first OS where OTA OS was introduced had some issues and bugs. He mentioned that from carrier's experience OTA updates have a very high conversion rate. In the 80%-s while even the through browser+USB update is less than 20% conversion rate. Until most of the devices are 4.6 and up and carriers are more aggressive pushing updates to the devices, we will be stuck with the need to support older devices as old as 4.2.1. Which leads us to further interesting figures:</p> <div id="_mcePaste">as of October 2009 the OS distribution is as follows:</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.2.1 97%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.5 50-60%   - over the air update</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.6 30%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.7 15%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">5.0 5-6%</div> <div>meaning supporting 4.2.1 will get you almost all the devices, while jumping to 4.5 and up will only give you about 50-60% and by going further up to 4.6, you will loose up to 30% of devices (this is due to huge number of older Curves and Pearls).</div> <div>I will be wrapping up since this post is already quite long.

While this might be convenient to some people, I got used to the "old" way of handling tabs and find myself constantly wondering where this new tab is.

Then, if needed click the “I’ll be careful, I promise!” button.</li> <li>In the filter box – type in: <strong><em>tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent</em></strong> <ul></ul> </li> <li>Right-click that <strong>about:config</strong> entry, and choose “Toggle”</li> </ul> <p>This will convert Firefox back to opening a new tab from a web page on the far right of the tab bar, rather than right next to the tab you opened it from.</p> <p>If you decide that you actually like it and want to switch back, follow these same steps and toggle the “false” back to “true”.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/successful-people-ship-or-what-makes-successful-enterpreneurs/"> Successful People SHIP </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>I've seen this video by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>, who is without any doubt a great thinker and visioner.

And this is absolutely true - successful people ship. I've known this for all this time, but this simple 3 words "slogan" so to say never formulated in my head. Intuitively I always felt this but after this presentation it just formed.</p> <p>Borrowing analogy from Math, shipping is a required condition but not satisfactory, meaning that just shipping you will not necessarily make successful, but if you DO NOT ship you will most definitely NOT be successful.</p> <p>Again, very inspiring presentation that may be an eye opener for some.

This is the question that Mike Kirkup - head of developer relations at RIM tried to answer today in a free webcast. There has been an obsession recently with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/07/super-duper-phone/" target="_blank">super phones</a> and super apps as it seems. And why phones and/or apps have to be necessarily super?</p> <p>So there seem to be two definitions of super apps according to Mike Kirkup.</p> <blockquote><p>If you take the blackberry phone from the user and he misses this app - then it is a super app since it provides an inherent value for the end user.</p></blockquote> <p>Another "definition" is more technical - so what are the main components that make a BlackBerry app a super app:</p> <ul> <li> <div>Always on experience</div> </li> <li> <div>Seamless integration with 3d party apps</div> </li> <li> <div>Notification driven</div> </li> </ul> <div>Not sure about you, but I see here a small misconception. On one side Mike says that if the application is extremely useful up to the point where if taken away from the user he will surely miss it but on the other hand there are specific points which actually make an app to be a super app. So what if the app is very useful to many people to the extent that they will surely miss it if taken away such as for example <a href="http://www.androidz.info/2009/07/dailyhoroscope-for-blackberry-officially-worldwide/" target="_blank">DailyHoroscope application for BlackBerry</a>. Because many users of DailyHoroscope application are going crazy and <a href="http://www.comitic.com/dailyhoroscope-recent-downtimes-exlpanation/" target="_blank">flood us with mails</a> in case we experience even minimal downtime. So the application is extremely useful to its users and certainly has value for them but according to the bullet points, DailyHoroscope is not a super app.</div> <div>The source of confusion I think is that Mike meant if you take away <strong>BlackBerry </strong>device from the user, then other devices that may have similar apps will not be able to fill the gap. That's what makes any BlackBerry app a <strong>super app</strong> I would guess. The push mechanism and the multitasking and deep integration is something that does not exist on iPhone and/or iPod Touch, but similar things exist on Android and WebOS and Maemo are also actively developed and progressing  towards richer and richer platform.</div> <p>So what makes specifically BlackBerry platform a super app enabler platform accodring to RIM? The first and the point which was put most of the emphasis was the “multi-threaded <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> with background apps”. Other enablers mentioned were:</p> <ul> <li> <div>Contextual integration with apps</div> </li> <li> <div>Rich event based notification model that integrates deeply in the system</div> </li> <li> <div>Efficient push services</div> </li> <li> <div>Integrated LBS and Mapping</div> </li> </ul> <p>Mike argued that the possibility of deep native integration allows easier “native” application integration in a cohesive manner into the system. The main point seems to be that since the applications do not have to invent everything from scratch by using built in components/services etc, the applications can deliver unified user experience which lowers the learning curve for the applications and eliminates most of the confusion in mastering a new app.</p> <p>Starting from <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> 5.0 RIM introduced (or better say exposed to 3d party developers) much richer built in components such as <strong>autocomplete</strong>, <strong>file picker</strong>, <strong>map field</strong>, <strong>browserfield</strong>, <strong>media player components</strong> (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr135/" target="_blank">JSR 135</a> or MMAPI)</p> <p>The power of push. Mike mentioned that RIM invented the push and were running it in production for more than 10 years and they know exactly what they are doing. (hear that Apple? haha... ). The push limitation for BIS is 8KB while for BES it is much higher and is specified by BES administrator but is hard limited (by I think 1MB in the older BES versions with much higher limit value in BES 5.0 - I think around 10Mb)</p> <p>Overall it was an interesting webcast and Mike did a great job talking about all the things that are great about BlackBerry platform. I personally was a little disappointed since I expected much more technical session.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Q/A Session:</h3> <p>Q&amp;A session was quite interesting. Mike zipped through more than 200 questions in less than 40 minutes with great and to the point answers. Thank you Mike! I documented the most interesting Q&amp;As to my taste and the ones that are most likely to be interesting to other developers.</p> <ul> <li> <div>When advertising will be available?</div> </li> <li> <div>For BB alliance the beta will be opening very soon. For the rest of the publishers - the time line promised by Mike was approximately 2 month</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Time for application approval?</div> </li> <li> <div>Depends on the type of the application submitted. In general it is about 10 days but they are supposedly getting at about 48 hours time</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Is the PUSH service free for all the developers?</div> </li> <li> <div>It is free for almost all the alliance partners but they are working on releasing it to all the developers</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>All those super apps running in the background will make the devices slow - what about more resources for the devices?</div> </li> <li> <div>Mike said that they will continue to innovate in the device area but the overall answer was extremely vague</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>More tutorials and code?</div> </li> <li> <div>There is a lot of tutorials and code currently available online but it is hard to find it. Current knowledge base will be restructured and reorganized and mostly replaced by developer resources which is some new knowledge base.</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Book for developers from RIM?</div> </li> <li> <div>Working on that with authors and the community RIM is unlikely to release the book of its own.</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Developers competition for super apps? Is it something that is coming?</div> </li> <li> <div>RIM is planning to run super app development challenge in 4 regions very soon and pick up the best super apps and showcase them in BBDevCon in the end of September</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>When 5.0 JDE will be out of Beta?</div> </li> <li> <div>5.0 JDE will be out of beta soon and will finally NOT require simulator restart to push the new build to the simulator (YEY!!! Great news, hopefully Eclipse will mirror that as well)</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>UI tools for <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> building</div> </li> <li> <div>Working on UI tool which will be drag and drop tool that will generate Java code for you (That would be a blessing, although knowing how RIM executes development tools projects, the tool might very likely be quite unusable for anything more serious than placing a label field with "Hello World")</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Paid applications worldwide timeline?</div> </li> <li> <div>Worldwide is particularly difficult since RIM is supporting more than 150 countries. Support will be rolled out increasingly</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Is JDE going to be phased out in favor of Eclipe?</div> </li> <li> <div>Not right now. When RIM will feel that Eclipse has matured enough it will happen, but in general Eclipse is destined to replace the JDE</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Are other development platforms going to be supported except Windows?</div> </li> <li> <div>Mac is in the pipeline and support is likely to appear until the end of the year</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>App World is not as advertised as Apple's App Store</div> </li> <li> <div>Rim will start being much more aggressive about promoting App World in the future but this is highly dependent on RIMS relations with carriers since RIM is tightly integrated with carriers and they rub each other's shoulder. (well, of course...)</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Payments through carriers as opposed to payment through PayPal</div> </li> <li> <div>App World 2.0 will have options to pay with either credit card, PayPal or through the carrier</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Is Verizon's store going to compete with App World?</div> </li> <li> <div>Not really as RIM is not competing with any of the 3d party stores like Handango, GetJar etc...</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Are subscription based payments going to be supported in App World 2.0?</div> </li> <li> <div>It is not clear exactly what it is going to be, but some sort of subscription payment will be available</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>What is the best cross framework to use for developing for BB?

Using wiki is quite useful in general and some people opt for using local wiki such as <a href="http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/">WikiPad</a> but for my needs, I opted for online wiki since I often times need to access it from various places. Maybe in the future I will post why I chose DokuWiki and some of my (objective) thoughts about comparison to other wikis and some of my likes and hates about DokuWiki (although there are much more “likes” than “hates” :) ). This post would be short and not about it</p> <p>Several times I just wanted to put a plain (pre formatted) text into the wiki for whatever reasons but I ran into a problem that DokuWiki isn’t really ready to support this. One option is to use <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</span></code> but then the lines are not word wrapped and for text it looks just weird. So at those various occasions I tried to search for a solution with little success until I just took xterm plugin and modified it slightly (mostly the style CSS file) which took me about 5 minutes to do (and took me about 30 minutes to write this post, and the corresponding DokuWiki Plugin page and test the browsers) and now we have a wpre plugin for DokuWiki for word wrapped preformatted text which seem to work on all recent major browsers. You can dowload it from NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE (the page on DokuWiki references this file)</p> <h3 id="supported-browsers">Supported browsers:</h3> <p>(I just tested whatever I had installed on my machine and all are pretty recent.

This is a new service from Google that in a sense makes your gmail inbox into twitter like account. But it is more than twitter like account. It includes conversations and embeddings from other sites like Picasa, Flickr, Youtube etc...</p> <p>The interesting question marks that raised in my head are:</p> <ol> <li>Is Google trying to compete with huge success of Twitter? (They are not trying to compete per se, they want the realtime information that's available on Twitter and is not (yet???) available to Google.</li> <li>Is this a step forward to <a href="http://wave.google.com" target="_blank">Google Wave</a>?</li> </ol> <p>Maybe it's actually both 1 and 2 and something else that we can not yet see in the big picture :)</p> <p>Google Buzz is also available on Mobile:</p> <p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/m-kcVDNi6eg&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/m-kcVDNi6eg&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object></p> <p>And here's the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/introducing-google-buzz.html" target="_blank">announcement of Google Buzz on the official Google blog</a></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page23/">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page21/">Newer</a> </div> </div> </body> </html>
