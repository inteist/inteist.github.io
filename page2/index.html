That’s a good sign.</p> <p>I have moved almost all my data from Os X Notes to Obsidian vault synced via Google Drive. So far, so good.</p> <p>We shall see whether it survives the several month “brain dump” activity though.

It is an easy fix with an ImageMagick subcommand - <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge">mogrify</code></p> <p>All you got to do is run:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code> mogrify <span class="nt">-alpha</span> off <span class="k">*</span>.png
</code></pre></div></div> <p>to turn <strong>off</strong> the alpha channel for all PNGs in a certain folder.</p> <p>Enjoy a hussle free upload to App Store with just one command line.</p> <p>Note, I have checked Explore Opaque plugin, but it never quite worked. It’s really cumbersome and has some bugs, I suppose. It was MUCH, MUCH easier and more straightforward to just export the images and then just run the above command.</p> <p>If you don’t have ImageMagick installed, it is easy to install with Homebrew.</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code> brew update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> brew <span class="nb">install </span>imagemagick

The thing is - this is an extension that hides an advertising sidebar on any Facebook sub-websites.</p> <p>This is quite annoying and that was a quick fix by copying the existing plugin, changing the metadata and side loading it.</p> <p>If you experience an extension that is blocked and you still want to use it - this is the way to go. Please note that most blocked extensions are blocked for a reason and you are doing this at your own risk.

I did not alter or change anything - my website just wasn’t working, even though I am sure it was working before.</p> <p>Looking at google analytics, it turns out my blog went dark on September 20 2020…</p> <p>I don’t know why or how… I suppose it was because of some changes GitHub made to their github pages hosting since my blog is generated with Jekyll and is hosted at Github pages.</p> <p>The Jekyll thing deserves a separate mention and discussion. I have had a lot of frustrations like I mentioned earlier due to the fact that Jekyll and/or some plugins always had issues and whenever I wanted to write someting I had to, well, resolve these issues… and since it was pretty much every time I wanted to blog - I had some new issues, I just gave up.</p> <p>I will follow up with a separate post on how I revived my 5 years old blog with Jekyll… A the moment as I type it, I am running on the latest ruby and the latest Jekyll. It was not a smooth sailing however and at some point I thought I’d have to compromise to running on Jekyll 2.X (the latest of which was 2.5.1 I think).</p> <p>But, alas, here we are - running on the latest ruby and Jekyll versions with all the new bells an whistles (are there any?).</p> <p>So… here’s to the renewed blogging.</p> <p>I have been interested in Flutter for a while and it looks like this is finally the time when it will all come together and I will finally make the plunge from native development to Flutter…</p> <p>Exciting times are ahead, so strap down, buckle up and and let’s go on this adventure together!</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/scheduling-randomized-cron-within-an-hour/"> Scheduling randomized cron within an hour or within a minute </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">18 Feb 2017</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>It is <strong>usually</strong> a good idea in general to add slight randomness to the start time of a cron job, especially if you are accessing some 3-d party resource to prevent flooding of 3-d party at the top of the hour or at the top of the minute.</p> <p>This will run the cron job every day sometime between 2pm-3pm and 2am–3am in a randomized manner</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code>0 2,14 <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span> <span class="nb">sleep</span> <span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">expr</span> <span class="nv">$RANDOM</span> <span class="se">\%</span> 3600<span class="si">)</span><span class="p">;</span> ~/bin/batch_job
