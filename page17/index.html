    <hr>

    <p>Today many people that will open their gmail will be faced with the dialog about Google buzz. This is a new service from Google that in a sense makes your gmail inbox into twitter like account. But it is more than twitter like account. It includes conversations and embeddings from other sites like Picasa, Flickr, Youtube etc...</p>

<p>The interesting question marks that raised in my head are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Google trying to compete with huge success of Twitter? (They are not trying to compete per se, they want the realtime information that's available on Twitter and is not (yet???) available to Google.</li>
<li>Is this a step forward to <a href="http://wave.google.com" target="_blank">Google Wave</a>?</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe it's actually both 1 and 2 and something else that we can not yet see in the big picture :)</p>

<p>Google Buzz is also available on Mobile:</p>

    <p>This is more of a personal notes for myself but I am sure others will find it useful.</p>

<p><strong>Apache:</strong></p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log</strong></p>

<p>All exceptions caught by httpd, along with standard error output form CGI applications are logged here.  The first place you should look when httpd crashes, or you incur errors when accessing a website.</p>

<p><strong> /usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log</strong></p>

<p>Contains auditing information reported by suexec each time a CGI applicaiton is executed.  If you receive an internal server error, with no relevant information being reported to the Apache error_log, check here for potential suexec policy violations.</p>

<p>Domain specific access logs are located here:</p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/apache/domlogs/</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>

<p>To find out which php.ini is used for PHP configuration (to save you frustration of editing a non active php.ini) find it with the following simple command:<br />
<strong>php -i | grep php.ini</strong></p>

<p>where -i switch is used to give you PHP information (obviously). To see other useful switches run</p>

<p><strong>php -h</strong></p>

<p>to locate where php is use:</p>

<p><strong>which php</strong></p>

<p>(but you already knew this - right ? :)  )</p>

<p>*** Some of these tips are applicable not only to CentOS and cPanel configuration.</p>

    <p>As I already wrote, [intlink id="75" type="post"]BlackBerry development is not a lot of fun[/intlink].  Not only you basically can not develop in Linux and OS X (although there are some workarounds, it makes the process even more painful than it already is). But you will also have problems with 64 bit operating systems. RIM is in a position that they do not officially support 64 bit systems.</p>

<p>The main problem with 64 bit Windows 7 for me was that I can not close the simulator (or actually the "fledge" application that runs the simulators). There are 2 possible solutions to this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill the task through task manager</li>
<li>The simulator should close if you are in debug mode and you disconnect the debug session</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also another inconvenience which is caused by your cautiously guarding Windows system. It will warn you every time that (Oh my!) fledge will change something on your computer. You know - the standard User Control Account message. To avoid that message always popping up, you will have to adjust your setting in User Control Account panel. Hit "Windows" then just type UCA, you will get it. Adjust it to the minimum and you'r good to go.</p>

        <!-- <span class=post-title-accent>></span> -->BlackBerry Development With Eclipse Plugin – Fixing Corrupted *.jdp File
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2009</span>
    <hr>

    <p>It's not a secret that Eclipse plugin is very buggy and although it has improved a lot over the time, [intlink id="75" type="post"]the blackberry plugin still has a lot of issues and quirks[/intlink]. One of the problems that have been bugging me a lot was that sometimes the *.jdp file gets corrupted. This is the file where BB plugin for Eclipse saves most of the meta data for the project, including the files that are included in the project and consequently need to be compiled. So, many times I had problems with SVN meta data files corrupting this project, or sometimes perfectly legitimate *.java files that get stuck in the *.jdp file, but do not exist anymore.  The result of the *.jdp file being corrupted is that your application does no longer get compiled and redeployed when you run it. And the worst part, Eclipse would not explicitly let you know about this. It would silently fail and not re-deploy the app. So unless this is the first time you run the application, or the changes you made are not visually obvious, you would not know about this. But this is completely separate issue. One of the many issues with BB Eclipse plugin already covered.  Each time I have been struggling (sometimes for significant amount of times). Couple times I was able to manually delete files from the *.jdp file (although this is not recommended by RIM) and this solved the problem, but mostly I had to recreate the whole project from scratch, which if your project is large and, which is more important has dependencies on libraries, may become painful if you need to do this every few days.</p>

<p>So the easiest way I found so far to solve this problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the *.jdp file (you can just rename it to *.jdp.OLD)</li>
<li>Delete the project from Eclipse (right click the project and choose delete). DO NOT however check the checkbox "delete the contents of the project from disk"</li>
<li>Create a new project and point it to the same place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since all the Eclipse project related files remain untouched, you should get your project exactly at the same state it was before it got corrupted, minus the corrupted part. Why - because when you re-create the project Eclipse plugin should re-create the *.jdp file.</p>

    <p>I wonder how many people have noticed the icon change for the new Firefox 3.5? It has been changed. The change is not very significant, but it was significant enough for me to take notice (with a significant delay though).</p>

<p>So here we go, old and new icons side by side:</p>

<p>The old and the new (respectively left to to right) side by side</p>

<p><img style="margin: 10px;" title="ff-old-icon" src="http://inteist.com/media/ff-old-icon.png" alt="ff-old-icon" width="215" height="215" /><img style="margin: 10px;" title="ff-new-icon" src="http://inteist.com/media/ff-new-icon.png" alt="ff-new-icon" width="215" height="215" /></p>

<p>The old and then the new one - larger versions :)</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-94 alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" title="ff-old-icon" src="http://inteist.com/media/ff-old-icon.png" alt="ff-old-icon" width="307" height="307" /><img class="size-full wp-image-95 alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" title="ff-new-icon" src="http://inteist.com/media/ff-new-icon.png" alt="ff-new-icon" width="307" height="307" /></p>

<p>Find the differences :)</p>

    <hr>

    <p>If you need to pop up a dialog or any screen actually from a process that runs in background on BlackBerry, it is fairly easy to do, unfortunately it is (as pretty much everything with BlackBerry development)  easy to <strong>figure out</strong> how to do.</p>

<p>The following piece of code should do the trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">synchronized</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Application</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getEventLock</span><span class="o">())</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">Ui</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getUiEngine</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">pushGlobalScreen</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">CLAScreen</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">UiEngine</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">GLOBAL_QUEUE</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are also a few things you should be aware of when using this code:</p>

    <p>Microsoft can very well loose the portable space completely. It already practically lost the mobile phones war. Although this happened not due to being able to support ARM processors, but due to the fact that mobile phone can not be efficiently powered by an operating system designed to be used on a desktop.</p>

<p>There are rumors that Microsoft is hoping to make a big splash in the Netbooks space. Netbooks are ultra small and portable laptops which are mainly intended to be used for internet - browsing/email/messaging and possibly light office tasks on the go. Those hopes however might just fall apart very easy with proliferation of Netbooks powered by ARM processors. Same processors that power most of our mobile phones.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.inventec.com/">"Inventec</a>, a Taiwanese company that makes laptops on behalf of several of the world's best-known PC brand names, is developing up to four Snapdragon laptop models for customers, said Mark Hirsch, vice president for marketing at the company." They will showcase one of the concept laptops at the Computex in Taipei. The reference laptop is  intended to demonstrate the possibilities of the platform uses a 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU. It has a 1,024 by 600 pixel resolution screen, a 64GB flash disk and integrated 3G wireless. And it only weighs about 800 grams - quite impressive for ~10" laptop.</p>

<p>Those specs clearly show that you get quite a useful package which is extremely light and portable, plus you can usually go for more than 6 hours with a typical network usage. Not like current WiFi connectivity, integrated 3G wireless promises everywhere connectivity easily accessible at speeds comparable to those you will get on a weak WiFi link.</p>

<p>All of the above clearly makes the Netbooks attractive productivity devices on the go and for small tasks and my guess is that we will see a lot of those small laptops coming very soon and which is more important many of them will be powered by ARM processors. Since Microsoft does not currently support ARM processors, they will not be able to compete with other OSes in this space. There were rumors that Windows 7 will support ARM architectures, but it was not officially confirmed yet.</p>

<p>Many Netbooks are coming out powered by flavors of Ubuntu linux or recently reworked Android operating systems. Being targeted at embedded devices and open source - Android is an ideal choice for underpowered, small devices.</p>

<p>The final word of proliferation of Netbooks will probably remain after WiMAX. If the Netbooks can support WiMAX better and it gets sufficiently widespread, more and more people will choose Netbook over traditional laptop, especially when the Netbooks can be 2-3 times as cheap as laptops and people that do not need the processing power but rather need battery life and better connectivity will choose Netbook over a laptop in a heartbeat.</p>

    <p>I have just signed up for the early pick developer program Palm inc is having for the developers. I have missed the window a little, since the submission process started about a week ago, but I think with my wast experience with developing for mobile devices and having diverse development platforms (I develop on Mac (OS-X)  and (PC) Windows  pretty much simultaneously, leaves me pretty good chances to be admitted.</p>

<p>WebOS is supposed to be at least as appealing as Android and iPhone. I personally like much more Android development than the iPhone development, but this is probably due to openness of the Android and the fact that I actually have quite successful application for Android, while iPhone development didn't result in end user product just yet. I am not even mentioning the Blackberry development...</p>

<p>You can submit the application <a title="Early SDK pick program for WebOS developers" href="http://sdkapplication.palm.com/sdkapplication/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <p>I was contemplating quite a lot about the title for this post. Originally I wanted to give it the title of "Why developing for Blackberry sucks" but then I thought it might be too harsh and does not really reflect the content of the post which is about comparing the experience of developing for Android and experience of developing for Blackberry and settled for the current title. There were other titles revolving in my head, but all of them were just variations of  the original "why developing for Blackberry sucks"</p>

<p>I have been developing for Android for some time and lately I have been working on developing for Blackberry and I must say development for Android wins hands down in all aspects. Many times, especially frustrated with Blackberry buggy IDE or other cumbersome experience I wanted to write this post, but I had to find the time for it.</p>

<p>So what is so bad about Blackberry development? It starts at the very basics - development environment. Google has developed a very nice plugin for Eclipse which works very well and even has the basics of support for visual editing of user iterface screens. RIM - the company behind Blackberry for a long time had their own development environment - JDE. Written using basic SWING components, there's no need to mention how bare boned and outdated it looked. They have recently introduced Eclipse plugin as well, but it is pretty buggy and half baked. It is hundreds times better than the first version of the plugin, but it is still from being stable and feature rich.</p>

<p>Then we have the emulators - gosh, why do I have to restart the emulator everytime I want to test a new build? It can take up to a few minutes to restart the emulators for the more advanced models. To feel the pain, just imagine the nightmare of programming the UI for Blackberry in that setup. And no, there is no visual helper that can show the layout quickly, not to mention visual builder.</p>

<p>The compiler, or more exactly the packager - "rapc" has many times weird problems and behaves like a whiny child with lots of attitude problems. Same goes for the MDS server emulator.</p>

<p>Compared to Android, this can be nightmare. Yes I've had some issues and observed buggy behavior with aapt while developing for Android, but it was quite easy to resolve. For the UI part of the development, Android beats Blackberry as well. Constructing layout using XML is much easier than writing actual Java code. (Apple had actually went one step furthergiving the developers visual tools.)</p>

<p>Localization is much easier in Android as well. Besides conceptually being easy, the support of the Eclipse plugin for localization is half baked and buggy and what's most important, it is not that easy to find documentation on how to implement localization for Blackberry in Eclipse.</p>

<p>The last but not the least (and in fact probably most important) is the vibrant, enthusiastic and active community of the Android platform. It is so much easier to find answers to any problems you have while developing for Android. I was a little considered about Android being all open source in a sense that there is no central authority with central responsibility for certain things, and Blackberry has all this and it turns out that what many enthusiasts can do, easily outweighs any size company organized or not.</p>
