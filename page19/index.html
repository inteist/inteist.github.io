This is the question that Mike Kirkup - head of developer relations at RIM tried to answer today in a free webcast. There has been an obsession recently with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/07/super-duper-phone/" target="_blank">super phones</a> and super apps as it seems. And why phones and/or apps have to be necessarily super?</p> <p>So there seem to be two definitions of super apps according to Mike Kirkup.</p> <blockquote><p>If you take the blackberry phone from the user and he misses this app - then it is a super app since it provides an inherent value for the end user.</p></blockquote> <p>Another "definition" is more technical - so what are the main components that make a BlackBerry app a super app:</p> <ul> <li> <div>Always on experience</div> </li> <li> <div>Seamless integration with 3d party apps</div> </li> <li> <div>Notification driven</div> </li> </ul> <div>Not sure about you, but I see here a small misconception. On one side Mike says that if the application is extremely useful up to the point where if taken away from the user he will surely miss it but on the other hand there are specific points which actually make an app to be a super app. So what if the app is very useful to many people to the extent that they will surely miss it if taken away such as for example <a href="http://www.androidz.info/2009/07/dailyhoroscope-for-blackberry-officially-worldwide/" target="_blank">DailyHoroscope application for BlackBerry</a>. Because many users of DailyHoroscope application are going crazy and <a href="http://www.comitic.com/dailyhoroscope-recent-downtimes-exlpanation/" target="_blank">flood us with mails</a> in case we experience even minimal downtime. So the application is extremely useful to its users and certainly has value for them but according to the bullet points, DailyHoroscope is not a super app.</div> <div>The source of confusion I think is that Mike meant if you take away <strong>BlackBerry </strong>device from the user, then other devices that may have similar apps will not be able to fill the gap. That's what makes any BlackBerry app a <strong>super app</strong> I would guess. The push mechanism and the multitasking and deep integration is something that does not exist on iPhone and/or iPod Touch, but similar things exist on Android and WebOS and Maemo are also actively developed and progressing  towards richer and richer platform.</div> <p>So what makes specifically BlackBerry platform a super app enabler platform accodring to RIM? The first and the point which was put most of the emphasis was the “multi-threaded <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> with background apps”. Other enablers mentioned were:</p> <ul> <li> <div>Contextual integration with apps</div> </li> <li> <div>Rich event based notification model that integrates deeply in the system</div> </li> <li> <div>Efficient push services</div> </li> <li> <div>Integrated LBS and Mapping</div> </li> </ul> <p>Mike argued that the possibility of deep native integration allows easier “native” application integration in a cohesive manner into the system. The main point seems to be that since the applications do not have to invent everything from scratch by using built in components/services etc, the applications can deliver unified user experience which lowers the learning curve for the applications and eliminates most of the confusion in mastering a new app.</p> <p>Starting from <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> 5.0 RIM introduced (or better say exposed to 3d party developers) much richer built in components such as <strong>autocomplete</strong>, <strong>file picker</strong>, <strong>map field</strong>, <strong>browserfield</strong>, <strong>media player components</strong> (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr135/" target="_blank">JSR 135</a> or MMAPI)</p> <p>The power of push. Mike mentioned that RIM invented the push and were running it in production for more than 10 years and they know exactly what they are doing. (hear that Apple? haha... ). The push limitation for BIS is 8KB while for BES it is much higher and is specified by BES administrator but is hard limited (by I think 1MB in the older BES versions with much higher limit value in BES 5.0 - I think around 10Mb)</p> <p>Overall it was an interesting webcast and Mike did a great job talking about all the things that are great about BlackBerry platform. I personally was a little disappointed since I expected much more technical session.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Q/A Session:</h3> <p>Q&amp;A session was quite interesting. Mike zipped through more than 200 questions in less than 40 minutes with great and to the point answers. Thank you Mike! I documented the most interesting Q&amp;As to my taste and the ones that are most likely to be interesting to other developers.</p> <ul> <li> <div>When advertising will be available?</div> </li> <li> <div>For BB alliance the beta will be opening very soon. For the rest of the publishers - the time line promised by Mike was approximately 2 month</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Time for application approval?</div> </li> <li> <div>Depends on the type of the application submitted. In general it is about 10 days but they are supposedly getting at about 48 hours time</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Is the PUSH service free for all the developers?</div> </li> <li> <div>It is free for almost all the alliance partners but they are working on releasing it to all the developers</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>All those super apps running in the background will make the devices slow - what about more resources for the devices?</div> </li> <li> <div>Mike said that they will continue to innovate in the device area but the overall answer was extremely vague</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>More tutorials and code?</div> </li> <li> <div>There is a lot of tutorials and code currently available online but it is hard to find it. Current knowledge base will be restructured and reorganized and mostly replaced by developer resources which is some new knowledge base.</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Book for developers from RIM?</div> </li> <li> <div>Working on that with authors and the community RIM is unlikely to release the book of its own.</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Developers competition for super apps?

Support will be rolled out increasingly</div> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <div>Is JDE going to be phased out in favor of Eclipe?</div> </li> <li> <div>Not right now.

Using wiki is quite useful in general and some people opt for using local wiki such as <a href="http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WikiPad</a> but for my needs, I opted for online wiki since I often times need to access it from various places. Maybe in the future I will post why I chose DokuWiki and some of my (objective) thoughts about comparison to other wikis and some of my likes and hates about DokuWiki (although there are much more "likes" than "hates" :) ). This post would be short and not about it.</p> <p>Several times I just wanted to put a plain (preformatted) text into the wiki for whatever reasons but I ran into a problem that DokuWiki isn't really ready to support this. One option is to use &lt;code&gt; but then the lines are not word wrapped and for text it looks just weird. So at those various occasions I tried to search for a solution with little success until I just took xterm plugin and modified it slightly (mostly the style CSS file) which took me about 5 minutes to do  (and took me about 30 minutes to write this post, and the corresponding DokuWiki Plugin page and test the browsers) and now we have a wpre plugin for DokuWiki for word wrapped preformatted text which seem to work on all recent major browsers.

There are 2 possible solutions to this problem:</p> <ol> <li>Kill the task through task manager</li> <li>The simulator should close if you are in debug mode and you disconnect the debug session</li> </ol> <p>There is also another inconvenience which is caused by your cautiously guarding Windows system.

One of the problems that have been bugging me a lot was that sometimes the *.jdp file gets corrupted. This is the file where BB plugin for Eclipse saves most of the meta data for the project, including the files that are included in the project and consequently need to be compiled. So, many times I had problems with SVN meta data files corrupting this project, or sometimes perfectly legitimate *.java files that get stuck in the *.jdp file, but do not exist anymore. The result of the *.jdp file being corrupted is that your application does no longer get compiled and redeployed when you run it. And the worst part, Eclipse would not explicitly let you know about this. It would silently fail and not re-deploy the app. So unless this is the first time you run the application, or the changes you made are not visually obvious, you would not know about this. But this is completely separate issue. One of the many issues with BB Eclipse plugin already covered. Each time I have been struggling (sometimes for significant amount of times). Couple times I was able to manually delete files from the *.jdp file (although this is not recommended by RIM) and this solved the problem, but mostly I had to recreate the whole project from scratch, which if your project is large and, which is more important has dependencies on libraries, may become painful if you need to do this every few days.</p> <p>So the easiest way I found so far to solve this problem is:</p> <ol> <li>Delete the *.jdp file (you can just rename it to *.jdp.OLD)</li> <li>Delete the project from Eclipse (right click the project and choose delete). DO NOT however check the checkbox "delete the contents of the project from disk"</li> <li>Create a new project and point it to the same place.</li> </ol> <p>Since all the Eclipse project related files remain untouched, you should get your project exactly at the same state it was before it got corrupted, minus the corrupted part. Why - because when you re-create the project Eclipse plugin should re-create the *.jdp file.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-icon-for-firefox-3-5"> New Icon for FireFox 3.5 </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2009</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>I wonder how many people have noticed the icon change for the new Firefox 3.5?

It already practically lost the mobile phones war. Although this happened not due to being able to support ARM processors, but due to the fact that mobile phone can not be efficiently powered by an operating system designed to be used on a desktop.</p> <p>There are rumors that Microsoft is hoping to make a big splash in the Netbooks space. Netbooks are ultra small and portable laptops which are mainly intended to be used for internet - browsing/email/messaging and possibly light office tasks on the go. Those hopes however might just fall apart very easy with proliferation of Netbooks powered by ARM processors. Same processors that power most of our mobile phones.</p> <p><a href="http://www.inventec.com/">"Inventec</a>, a Taiwanese company that makes laptops on behalf of several of the world's best-known PC brand names, is developing up to four Snapdragon laptop models for customers, said Mark Hirsch, vice president for marketing at the company." They will showcase one of the concept laptops at the Computex in Taipei. The reference laptop is  intended to demonstrate the possibilities of the platform uses a 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU. It has a 1,024 by 600 pixel resolution screen, a 64GB flash disk and integrated 3G wireless. And it only weighs about 800 grams - quite impressive for ~10" laptop.</p> <p>Those specs clearly show that you get quite a useful package which is extremely light and portable, plus you can usually go for more than 6 hours with a typical network usage. Not like current WiFi connectivity, integrated 3G wireless promises everywhere connectivity easily accessible at speeds comparable to those you will get on a weak WiFi link.</p> <p>All of the above clearly makes the Netbooks attractive productivity devices on the go and for small tasks and my guess is that we will see a lot of those small laptops coming very soon and which is more important many of them will be powered by ARM processors. Since Microsoft does not currently support ARM processors, they will not be able to compete with other OSes in this space. There were rumors that Windows 7 will support ARM architectures, but it was not officially confirmed yet.</p> <p>Many Netbooks are coming out powered by flavors of Ubuntu linux or recently reworked Android operating systems. Being targeted at embedded devices and open source - Android is an ideal choice for underpowered, small devices.</p> <p>The final word of proliferation of Netbooks will probably remain after WiMAX. If the Netbooks can support WiMAX better and it gets sufficiently widespread, more and more people will choose Netbook over traditional laptop, especially when the Netbooks can be 2-3 times as cheap as laptops and people that do not need the processing power but rather need battery life and better connectivity will choose Netbook over a laptop in a heartbeat.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page20">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page18">Newer</a> </div> </div> </body> </html>
