That is until the 1.1 plugin comes out from beta, or at least that what was promised at the [intlink id="167" type="post"]New England BlackBerry developers meetup[/intlink].</p> <p><strong>3) The BlackBerry plugin would follow the "Eclipse way"</strong></p> <p>The 1.1 plugin is very different from previous version. Instead of following the "JDE way" it will be much more the natural "Eclipse way". This is both good and bad. This is very good for developers that have experience with Eclipse and just now start to develop for BlackBerry. This will however be somewhat painful for the seasoned developers who got used to the old plugin and will need to discover many things from scratch. (I personally felt quite lost with the new 1.1 plugin and decided to stick with the old one until 1.1 comes out of beta).</p> <p>You can download the beta of 1.1 from <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/devbetasoftware/javaplugin.jsp" target="_blank">here</a> (you would need to have BlackBerry developer account which is <strong>free</strong> and can be obtained with simple sign up immediately)</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/super-app-webcast-questions-answered-follow-up/"> Super App Webcast Q&A Follow-Up </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>During the [intlink id="136" type="post"]Super App webcast[/intlink] Mike Kirkup covered many questions from the attendees. I have gathered many of those in the webcast summary. He did not get through all of the questions and promised to answer all of the questions on <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Development/ct-p/BlackBerryDevelopment" target="_blank">blackberry development forum</a>. He did just that and here is the Q&amp;A extracted:</p> <p><strong>[Q] The problem I found with a super app that was tightly integrated with the address book is that people were looking to see an icon and not something that was just part of the existing BlackBerry UI.</strong></p> <p>[A] A good point.  Many users will still expect a simple icon for the application whether only to provide information on how to leverage the application or how to manipulate settings.  Fixmo is a really good example of this point.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Is there a way for my app to get notified when new notifications are shown on the device?</strong></p> <p>[A] Unfortunately, no.  But this sounds like a great feature request you should log via the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/issuetracker" target="_self">BlackBerry Issue Tracker</a>.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Is there a way to include full camera control in the application?</strong></p> <p>[A] Yes.  Check out JSR 135 (MMAPI) for more information on how to include the camera field within your application including the ability to modify zoom and flash settings.</p> <p><strong>[Q] With the definition of a "Super App" being one that you cannot live without, can a game be a super app?</strong></p> <p>[A] Great question!  Yes, a game definitely can be a "Super App" or take on many of the characteristics of a Super App including being notification driven, contextual (even location based), integrated with other applications and so on.  It isn't hard to imagine having a game that you love so much that you can't live without it.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Can I make a Super App by developing a BlackBerry Widget?</strong></p> <p>[A] Yes, definitely.  One of the most important attributes of the our Widget technology is that you can fully integrate your Widget into all of the same APIs that are available to Java applications whether exposed already through Javascript APIs or through your ability to write Javascript to Java APIs.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Do you plan on setting up a program to certify applications as Super Apps?</strong></p> <p>[A] No, we do not currently have any plans for certifying applications as a Super App today.  The concept here is to help people really understand not only the capabilities of the BlackBerry platform but also the possibilities on better engaging your users.</p> <p><strong>[Q] We have developed a collaboration application which works on a "pull" basis.  How can we leverage push?</strong></p> <p>[A] Check out our newly launched <a rel="nofollow" href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/javaappdev/pushapi.jsp" target="_self">Push Services page</a> for more information on how you can start leveraging push in your application whether for the enterprise or consumers.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Is it possible to add a custom menu item in any third party application? </strong></p> <p>[A] Yes, although not in a granular fashion today.  As part of the ApplicationMenuItem API you can specify that you want your menu item included in all applications on the device but you do not get to pick which applications if you don't want all apps.  Can you submit a feature request in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/issuetracker" target="_self">Developer Issue Tracker</a> if you think this is a good use case.</p> <p><strong>[Q] Suppose the application flow is such that screen 1 pushes screen 2, screen 2 pushes screen 3 and from screen 3 the user needs to go to screen 1.  Should the application push screen 1 again or pop screens to get to screen1?</strong></p> <p>[A] You should definitely maintain the proper ordering of the screens on the stack for the user such that your application will automatically pop off the top screen on the stack when the user presses the escape key.  So, in this case, it depends on your ultimate goal of the screens.</p> <p><strong>[Q] This is a great presentation but it gives very little to seasoned developers.  Will you have additional presentations with more details and more code samples? (Editor: <em>this, I think is actually my question slightly rephrased</em>)<br /> </strong></p> <p>[A] Yes, definitely.  This is the introduction to the concept of Super Apps and you will see additional webinar presentations that go into substantially more detail on all of the key aspects of bringing Super Apps characteristics to your application.  The Big Ideas, Little Screens UI Webinar from Brian this month is a perfect example of more involved webinars.</p> <p><strong>[Q] What are the OS or device requirements for the Javascript examples provided?</strong></p> <p>[A] These are part of the new <a rel="nofollow" href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/devbetasoftware/widgetsdk.jsp" target="_self">BlackBerry Widget technology</a> and require v5.0 handheld software.</p> <p><strong>[Q] You mentioned the Super Apps website.  Where is that?</strong></p> <p>[A] <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/superapps" target="_self">www.blackberry.com/developers/superapps</a></p> <p>He also promised to keep posting answers so see the original forum thread <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/BlackBerry-Super-Apps-Webinar-Follow-up/td-p/466845" target="_blank">here</a> for more information</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/building-secure-mobile-applications-att-free-webcast/"> Building Secure Mobile Applications - AT&T Free Webcast </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>AT&amp;T will host a webcast about building secure mobile applications on April 1-st.

He claims that it's almost all of the applicants, which I find hard to believe. I tend to think that their resume evaluation techniques are just not good enough, which is surprising since Jeff is good friends with Joel Spolsky who had an interesting article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SortingResumes.html" target="_blank">screening resumes</a>.</p> <p>Anyways, Jeff's article is not about that. It's about a little nifty tool that will allow you to see other person type. It's very simple you give your interviewee a link and open a link in your browser and can see everything the other person types with a couple seconds lag. This tool is definitely nice, but hell, why not just use google wave? It's easy, many technical people should already have it. If the programmer applying doesn't have it and doesn't have a good reason as to why this is so you should think twice about putting further time and effort in the interview process.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-england-blackberry-developer-meetup-group-first-meetup-notes/"> New England BlackBerry Developer Meetup Group - First Meetup Notes </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>Last night I have attended local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-England-BlackBerry-Developers/" target="_blank">New England BlackBerry developer meetup group</a>. It was a great event with nice turnout of about 50 developers with special guest - Mike Kirkup - director of developer relations at RIM.</p> <p>Mike is a great speaker and a great guy in general. BlackBerry developers are truly blessed with Mike in that sense. So much has been done to ease up on the [intlink id="75" type="post"] hurdles of BlackBerry development[/intlink] recently that it is becoming cool to be BlackBerry developer once again.</p> <p>The meetup was hosted by a local software development company - <a href="http://www.softartisans.com" target="_blank">SoftArtisans</a>. They develop <a href="http://silverdust.softartisans.com">SharePoint solutions for BlackBerry</a>.</p> <p>Mike was give the stage and he went over the BlackBerry super app concept which was similar to the [intlink id="136" type="post"]BlackBerry super app concept webcast[/intlink] he gave recently but a little different of course with some stuff oriented more towards developers.</p> <p>The highlight was of course the free panel Q&amp;A session which was afterwards. Mike, as usual, did a very nice job answering the questions of the many developers who brought up interesting questions.</p> <h3>Upcoming Products</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/business/server/express/" target="_blank">BES Express</a> (or BESX) which is the <strong>free</strong>, striped down version of the BES server. This will allow smaller businesses to put their employees on BESX without hesitation which originated from the costs of licensing associated with putting employees on BES.</li> <li>[intlink id="168" type="post"]Upcoming WebKit browser[/intlink] which will be <strong>blazing fast</strong> and <strong>super blazing fast</strong> for JavaScript.</li> <li>There will be no iPad like device.</li> </ul> <blockquote><p>"No iPad, no BlackPad, BluePad, RedPad etc..."</p></blockquote> <ul> <li>Advertising APIs. Right now RIM is conducting a closed beta with their partners and should be soon available to all independent developers. There is no cap on the volume, meaning pretty much anyone would be able to integrate advertising in their apps.</li> <li><a href="http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/03/introducing-blackberry-push-services-to-developers/" target="_blank">Push APIs</a> (well this is not an upcoming event actually, it went live today at 9am). Push API is available to everyone now and is <strong>free!</strong></li> <li>App World 2.0 will soon be launched. The next version of the app world will support not only the PayPal but also the carrier and credit cards. The share of developers will most likely be different across all the optios and across the different network operators as well. PayPal option will remain 20/80% split with 80% going to the developers.</li> <li>In a few weeks the new Eclipse plugin for BlackBerry development version 1.1 should be released, which will address many issues existing in the older 1.0 browser. The official release of 1.1 which should go out of beta will be fully supporting 64 bit systems.</li> </ul> <h3>Upcoming Events</h3> <ul> <li>Very soon we would have "fast simulator experience" so painful to many developers that when announced, it was followed by applause storm. So fast simulator experience means no more restarting the simulator to load the newly compiled version. (Yey!)</li> <li>More aggressive promotion of the App World. Mike mentioned that RIM intentionally kept the App World low profile for the first year letting the carriers figure out their distribution strategies.</li> <li>Super App competition. The super app competition will be carried out with a different prize distribution model than previously. RIM decided instead of rewarding a few leading application with big bonuses, reward more developers with moderate bonuses. Mike mentioned that they expect 3000-4000 apps submitted to the contest (both new and existing apps can be submitted) and if your app passes the first criteria of actually being a super app, then you are already entitled to something. Mike threw out "a free device" in the air but I guess it is not yet decided. They may go with a free device or maybe discounted developer conference or maybe we could choose. Let us know in the comments what <strong>you </strong>would prefer. The prizes will be handed out at BB Dev Con in San-Francisco at fall and the submission deadline will most likely be July 1-st but this is not confirmed yet.</li> </ul> <p>The painful question of over the air (OTA) OS upgrade was raised and Mike said that carriers feel  fairly confident with pushing OTA OS update starting with OS 4.6 since 4.5 being the first OS where OTA OS was introduced had some issues and bugs. He mentioned that from carrier's experience OTA updates have a very high conversion rate. In the 80%-s while even the through browser+USB update is less than 20% conversion rate. Until most of the devices are 4.6 and up and carriers are more aggressive pushing updates to the devices, we will be stuck with the need to support older devices as old as 4.2.1. Which leads us to further interesting figures:</p> <div id="_mcePaste">as of October 2009 the OS distribution is as follows:</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.2.1 97%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.5 50-60%   - over the air update</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.6 30%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">4.7 15%</div> <div id="_mcePaste">5.0 5-6%</div> <div>meaning supporting 4.2.1 will get you almost all the devices, while jumping to 4.5 and up will only give you about 50-60% and by going further up to 4.6, you will loose up to 30% of devices (this is due to huge number of older Curves and Pearls).</div> <div>I will be wrapping up since this post is already quite long.

While this might be convenient to some people, I got used to the "old" way of handling tabs and find myself constantly wondering where this new tab is. I might give it a few more days to see whether I get used to it but in case you are annoyed by that too and want to "fix" this here is how you can disable the new “Insert Related Tab After Current” tweak in Firefox 3.6.</p> <ul> <li>Type<strong> about:config</strong> in the address bar. Then, if needed click the “I’ll be careful, I promise!” button.</li> <li>In the filter box – type in: <strong><em>tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent</em></strong> <ul></ul> </li> <li>Right-click that <strong>about:config</strong> entry, and choose “Toggle”</li> </ul> <p>This will convert Firefox back to opening a new tab from a web page on the far right of the tab bar, rather than right next to the tab you opened it from.</p> <p>If you decide that you actually like it and want to switch back, follow these same steps and toggle the “false” back to “true”.</p> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/successful-people-ship-or-what-makes-successful-enterpreneurs/"> Successful People SHIP </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2010</span> <div class="link-underline"> <p>I've seen this video by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>, who is without any doubt a great thinker and visioner.

And this is absolutely true - successful people ship. I've known this for all this time, but this simple 3 words "slogan" so to say never formulated in my head. Intuitively I always felt this but after this presentation it just formed.</p> <p>Borrowing analogy from Math, shipping is a required condition but not satisfactory, meaning that just shipping you will not necessarily make successful, but if you DO NOT ship you will most definitely NOT be successful.</p> <p>Again, very inspiring presentation that may be an eye opener for some.
